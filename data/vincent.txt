The event Here to Stay: Celebrating 40 Years at the Architecture Archives is held during Ongoing at the Location Hunt Library, Fourth Floor The Price is N/A Description of the event is N/A. Curator is Lynn Kawaratani Art Director is Heidi Wiren Kebe. Settlement, industrialization, urbanization, and redevelopment have each left a profound mark on the region’s built environment. The architecture bears testimony to the forces that shaped it, but buildings can only tell part of the stories. The histories of their conception, design, and construction are contained in the drawings and other documents shared between clients, architects, and contractors. These architectural records document an irretrievable past (for buildings demolished or left unbuilt), facilitate the preservation and reuse of extant buildings, and inform our understanding of our surroundings.
For the past forty years, the Architecture Archives collections at Carnegie Mellon University have documented thousands of projects and the work of hundreds of designers. Records have been obtained from architects and their firms, families, property owners, and governments. This wide diversity of materials—preliminary sketches, renderings, specifications, photographs, publications, and architectural models—helps piece together the rich history of Pittsburgh and the region.A 360 Virtual Tour allows remote visitors to take a self-guided tour.

This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences. The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition,A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime. Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.

He captivates her with this whimsical story that removes her far from the hospital doldrums into the exotic landscapes of her imagination. “Tarsem Singh’s ‘The Fall’ is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself. Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance ‘The Fall,’ filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.”—Roger Ebert Directed by Tarsem Singh 2006 | USA, India | English, Romanian, and Latin language with English subtitles | DCP Rated R Contact Us412-566-4190Email Us Pittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Share this page

One would not have been possible without the other.” -- Roger Ebert Werner Herzog is the reigning champ of impossible real-life adventures undertaken in the name of cinema. And this masterpiece is the romantic flipside to AGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD — a backbreaking epic that ecstatically treads the line between a portrait of madness and a genuine expression of obsession. FITZCARRALDO fictionalizes the mad, true-life mission of South American rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald to establish an opera house in the Peruvian jungle -- which can only be accomplished by hauling a gigantic river boat over a mountain. No special effects here -- this is the real deal, with the impossible results executed before your eyes.

For nearly five years, Herzog desperately tried to complete one of the most ambitious and difficult films of his career, Fitzcarraldo, the story of one man’s attempt to build an opera house deep in the Amazon jungle. Documentary filmmaker Les Blank captured the unfolding of this production, made more perilous by Herzog’s determination to shoot the most daunting scenes without models or special effects, including a sequence requiring hundreds of indigenous Peruvians to pull a full-size, 320-ton steamship over a small mountain. The result is an extraordinary document of the filmmaking process and a unique look into the single-minded mission of one of cinema’s most fearless directors. Blank’s interviews with Hersog, bring context and backstory to his personalized style of “ethnographic filmmaking,” which values Peru’s native, Campa, Machiguenga, and Aguaruna people and their Old World culture as much as it does Herzog’s perilous enterprise.

Over the course of a slew of acclaimed studio and live albums and countless tours and festivals, the band has gone on to become one of biggest success stories in independent music history, selling out three nights at Madison Square Garden and drawing over 100,000 fans to a massive outdoor show in their adopted hometown of Boston without any traditional radio or major label support. The band recently released their extraordinary 8th studio album, Break Our Fall, to critical acclaim. In 2022, DISPATCH hit the road with O.A.R. for their first-ever North American Co-Headline Tour. Joined by special guest G. Love, the bands kicked things off in Mesa, AZ and weaved their way throughout the US through mid-September, making 37 stops in Los Angeles, San Diego, Denver, Atlanta, Cleveland, Nashville, Boston, Chicago, New York, Philly, Austin, Virginia Beach and more. While the bands have previously played on the same bill, this tour will mark the first time the two have shared a tour together. This year, they embarked on a new journey for their Summer Stops tour which included two symphony shows—with the National Symphony Orchestra at Wolf Trap, and the Colorado Symphony at Red Rocks in Colorado. Throughout their rise, DISPATCH has taken every opportunity to use their success for good, launching charitable organizations to fight inequality and mass incarceration, raising funds and awareness for environmental causes, schools and hospitals on the road, and even traveling as far afield as Zimbabwe to work with children and communities in need. Chadwick Stokes’ Calling All Crows joins bands and fans together in collective activism that has raised more than half a million dollars, while Brad Corrigan’s Love Light + Melody helps amplify the stories of children who live in extreme poverty. Dispatch is partnering withCalling All Crowsto promote the AMPlifying Democracy campaign, which leverages the power of music to inspire, activate, and boost civic engagement during this critical election year. Fans will get to participate in activities that promote a thriving and equitable democracy both nationally and locally. AMPlifying Democracy’s ultimate goal is to define, engage, and celebrate our democratic process regardless of party lines.

The name of the event is Cinema Laika (2024) and Ariel (1988), the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Entertainment,Film & Movies, it will be held during Oct 10, 2024 - Oct 10, 2024 | 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm at Harris Theater809 Liberty AvePittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: With filmmaker Veljko Vidak in attendance! Following Q&A with Vidak, we'll screen ARIEL (1988) by Aki Kaurismäki. In a small village in Finland, which has relied solely on metallurgical activities for the past two centuries, Aki Kaurismäki and his friend, the poet and writer Mika Lätti, are constructing their own cinema within an old foundry. Employing recycled wood, metal, and pre-owned furniture, Kaurismäki and the residents of Karkkila collaboratively craft Kino Laika. The venue is surrounded by Cadillacs, motorcycles, rock bars, and the awe-inspiring beauty of nature, encapsulating the very essence of cinema’s enchantment – a place where the magic resides in its profound capacity to instigate change. In chronicling the creation of Kino Laika, Croatian-French filmmaker Veljko Vidak has created a modest yet finely-crafted film that is simultaneously a documentary about a particular cultural project, a more wide-ranging filmic meditation on the nature of cinema, and a portrait of a small-town community. Transcending the usual documentary trappings, CINEMA LAIKA radiates a deadpan charm and bemused curiosity about humanity that calls to mind nothing so much as the work of Kaurismäki himself. About Ariel: In Kaurismäki’s drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. ARIEL, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki’s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map.

Daytime Revolution takes us back in time to the week that John Lennon and Yoko Ono descended upon a Philadelphia broadcasting studio to co-host the iconic Mike Douglas Show, at the time the most popular show on daytime television with an audience of 40 million viewers a week. What followed was five unforgettable episodes of television, with Lennon and Ono at the helm and Douglas bravely keeping the show on track. Acting as both producers and hosts, Lennon and Ono handpicked their guests, including controversial choices like Yippie founder Jerry Rubin and Black Panther Chairman Bobby Seale, as well as political activist Ralph Nader and comic truth teller George Carlin. Their version of daytime TV was a radical take on the traditional format, incorporating candid Q&A sessions with their transfixed audience, conversations about current issues like police violence and women’s liberation, conceptual art events, and one-of-a-kind musical performances, including a unique duet with Lennon and Chuck Berry and a poignant rendition of Lennon’s “Imagine”. A document of the past that speaks to our turbulent present, Daytime Revolution captures the power that art can have when it reaches out to communicate, the prescience of that dialogue, and the bravery of two artists who never took the easy way out as they fought for their vision of a better world.

This special screening includes two classics directed by and starring Buster Keaton, and both with live accompaniment! First up is SHERLOCK JR (1924) with a live piano score by Tom Roberts: Keaton’s classic about a lovestruck projectionist who falls asleep during a show and dreams he has entered the film as a detective is a delightful and ingenious comedy.Sherlock Jr.is a high point of silent cinema, featuring one of Keaton’s cleverest conceits, and doubling as a reflection on cinema itself. About Tom Roberts: Tom Roberts is one of the leading scholars of early jazz piano in the world today (as stated by Ricardo Sciavales in The Heart and Soul of Stride, Blues, and Swing Piano). He has performed onThe Tonight Showwith Johnny Carson,The Statler Brothers Showon TNN, andA Prairie Home Companionwith Garrison Keillor. Tom was pianist for Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks in New York City and pianist and musical director for Leon Redbone for six years. Tom has recorded over 40 compact discs and has performed throughout the United States and Europe. And then our second film, THE NAVIGATOR (1924), with a live score by The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: In this revered silent comedy, the wealthy and impulsive Rollo Treadway (Buster Keaton) decides to propose to his beautiful socialite neighbor, Betsy O'Brien (Kathryn McGuire). Alhough Betsy turns Rollo down, he still opts to go on the cruise that he intended as their honeymoon. When circumstances find both Rollo and Betsy on the wrong ship, they end up having adventures on the high seas, allowing Keaton plenty of opportunities to display his trademark agility. About the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra began life in 2007 as the Ivy Leaf Orchestra, an ensemble formed to provide live musical accompaniment for silent films. Our first performance was for the 1917 Douglas Fairbanks feature, A Modern Musketeer. Since then the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra has provided music for a wide variety of classic comedies and dramatic films. The ensemble utilizes music published between 1885 and 1930, including hundreds of compositions specifically written for theatre orchestras and movie accompaniment. We call ourselves an orchestra even though by modern standards we’re really a chamber ensemble because that was the tradition in the silent era; as long as you had at least two instrumentalists, you had an orchestra! The PFO is a flexible ensemble (ranging from 2 to 22 players), and the ensemble emulates the best aspects of film accompaniment from the silent era to provide an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying viewing experience.

Early in the career of Bay Area experimental musicians Negativland, Mark Hosler recalls declaring, “Let’s just pretend we’re a band.” Using the safe familiar concept of “a band” as cover for their culture-jamming mayhem, the multimedia collective went on to test the limits of composition, sound, and copyright laws, while gathering more members and ardent fans along the way. ABOUT THE FILM: Filmmaker and frequent Negativland collaborator, Ryan Worsley has amplified, expanded, and recontextualized sounds and images from the band’s 40-plus year career into a documentary that breaks free of the typical Behind the Music narrative. Pulling from a wealth of recordings, home movies, performances, news reports, interviews, and intercepted radio signals, Stand By for Failure is a riptide collage of media about media about media. ABOUT THE LIVE PERFOMANCE: After the movie, legendary sound collage group Negativland and “real-time cinema” visual artist SUE-C collaborate to bring you their latest audio-visual performance about our minds, our realities, and the evolving forms of media and technology that orchestrate our perceptions as we head into our next election — titled WE CAN REALLY FEEL LIKE WE’RE HERE.

The name of the event is The Substance, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Entertainment,Film & Movies, it will be held during Sep 20, 2024 - Oct 3, 2024 at Harris Theater809 Liberty AvePittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: Demi Moore satirises Hollywood ageism in this audacious and gory feminist body horror that was the talk of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Elisabeth Sparkle is a faded fiftysomething star who’s just been fired from her TV workout show by a sleazy executive. Then she learns about ‘The Substance’: a mysterious injection that “unlocks your DNA”, birthing a young, gorgeous version of yourself from your own spine. Of course, there’s a catch: every seven days, one body heads out into the world while the other enters recuperative stasis. So when Elisabeth’s ambitious younger self refuses to surrender her newfound fame, the elder begins paying the price… with a gruesome physical disintegration. In a daringly deranged lead performance, Moore leans in to Elisabeth’s professional self-loathing with zeal. And as her rebellious clone, Margaret Qualley (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) matches the mayhem at every turn, while the cast that includes Dennis Quaid revels in going ham with the film’s outrageous premise. French director Coralie Fargeat (Revenge) ruthlessly marshals Cronenbergian tropes, from 1980s-inspired production design to some truly superlative prosthetics, provocatively depicting the turmoil of ageing as a woman in a patriarchal world: the horror that part of oneself may be gone forever. Directed by Coralie Fargeat 2024 | USA, United Kingdom, France | English language | DCP Rated R Contact Us412-566-4190Email Us Pittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Share this page

The name of the event is Kim Bond: We Are Not Alone, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Sep 6, 2024 - Jan 12, 2025 at 707 Gallery707 Penn AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

The name of the event is Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Oct 25, 2024 - Jan 5, 2025 at Wood Street Galleries601 Wood StPittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

The name of the event is Kim Bond: We Are Not Alone, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Sep 6, 2024 - Jan 12, 2025 at 707 Gallery707 Penn AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

The name of the event is Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Oct 25, 2024 - Jan 5, 2025 at Wood Street Galleries601 Wood StPittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

The name of the event is Kim Bond: We Are Not Alone, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Sep 6, 2024 - Jan 12, 2025 at 707 Gallery707 Penn AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

The name of the event is Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Oct 25, 2024 - Jan 5, 2025 at Wood Street Galleries601 Wood StPittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

The name of the event is KAWS + Warhol, the category of the event is Arts + Culture, it will be held during May 18, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025 at The Andy Warhol Museum117 Sandusky StreetPittsburgh, PA 15212, the description of the event is here: From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol’s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America’s most loved cereal boxes including Reese’s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol’s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol’s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.

The name of the event is Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories, the category of the event is Arts + Culture,Free event, it will be held during Oct 25, 2024 - Jan 5, 2025 at Wood Street Galleries601 Wood StPittsburgh, PA 15222, the description of the event is here: Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

ROBERTO CLEMENTE DAY
Roberto Clemente Day
Roberto Clemente Day was established by Major League Baseball to honor the life and legacy of Pirates great, Hall of Famer and 15-time All-Star who died in a plane crash on New Year's Eve 1972 while attempting to deliver supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. Each year, teams across the league honor his memory by giving back to their communities.

Pirates Celebrate Clemente Day
To honor the life and legacy of Roberto Clemente, the Pittsburgh Pirates front office staff, players and coaches volunteered throughout the city of Pittsburgh for the Pirates annual Clemente Day of Service presented by Fanatics.

To grow the game of baseball, Pirates volunteers were joined by staff from Duquesne Light Company and SportsNet Pittsburgh to renovate three fields home to hundreds of Northside RBI athletes. Pirates President, Travis Williams, helped with the field renovation projects before heading over to Pittsburgh's Strip District for a drive through food distribution in partnership with the Veterans Leadership Program. Here, volunteers assembled bags of produce and non-perishable foods that were given to over 150 veterans and their families.

Pirates players and coaches provided instruction to cancer patients during their morning workout at the Allegheny Health Network Exercise Oncology Center. After the session, patients and AHN staff were treated to nutritious post-class snacks and Pirates goodies. Volunteers also wrote notes of encouragement which were attached to 100 Pirates hats then delivered to patients across the region who are receiving care through the AHN Cancer Institute, specifically patients enrolled in AHN's new wig program.

Volunteers from the Pirates and Sheetz were hard at work at the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh reorganizing and replenishing the donation center, preparing meals for residents, and even provided breakfast and baked goods for the staff and volunteers who support WCS residents and clients.

To celebrate the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month, volunteers from Fanatics joined the Pirates at the Latino Community Center. There, volunteers restocked the center's food pantry, assembled furniture and set up new toys and games in the early childhood classroom, and built 200 snack packs for any of their kids facing food insecurity.

Meanwhile at PNC Park, volunteers wrote notes and letters to World War II veterans, which will be delivered to veterans visiting The National WWII Museum with the help of the Gary Sinise Foundation's Soaring Valor Mail Call program.

Throughout the day, nearly 150 front office and corporate partner volunteers and 35 players and coaches took part in this day of service, giving back to the Pittsburgh community.

'We just love this program': Pirates host Miracle League Fantasy Camp

'We just love this program': Pirates host Miracle League Fantasy Camp

PITTSBURGH -- Cool temperatures and periodic raindrops did nothing to quell the enthusiasm at the Miracle League of Southwestern Pennsylvania facility at Graham Park in Cranberry Township, Pa., on Saturday morning. Instead, smiles, laughter and high fives were abundant during a Miracle League Fantasy Camp for children and young adults with special needs that was hosted by the Pirates and sponsored by Baseball Fantasy Camp for Kids.

Pirates Charities, the philanthropic arm of the team, has played a vital role in the construction of nine Miracle League fields -- eight in the Pittsburgh region and one in Bradenton, Fla. -- and the first was in Cranberry Township, which opened in 2009. Since then, Pirates Charities has donated more than $1.75 million to Miracle League organizations to help build fields, develop complexes, cover operating expenses and provide a fun place where everyone belongs.


“The Miracle League program really is special to the Pirates organization, and special to me personally,” Pirates chairman Bob Nutting said just before the festivities got underway at Graham Park. “These kids didn’t always get a chance to play. They were told no so often. There were so many barriers and challenges. So, to have a field like this where they’re able to be out there enjoying themselves -- a field that’s made for them -- is tremendous. It’s a place where you can say, ‘Come on, let’s go have some fun and take a break from what’s hard.’”

Saturday’s event included 50 Miracle League athletes, who rotated through four stations where they received tips and assistance with hitting, pitching, fielding and baserunning. In addition to Nutting, the Pirates’ contingent also included team president Travis Williams, general manager Ben Cherington, a pair of players on the injured list -- catcher Endy Rodriguez and pitcher Daulton Jefferies -- the Pirate Parrot and the Pirate Pierogies. Active players were unable to participate because Friday night’s postponement created a make-up game against the Nationals at 1:35 p.m. on Saturday.

Mike Sherry, the president and founder of the Miracle League of Southwestern Pennsylvania, pointed out that a little more than 100 players were part of this program back in 2009, and the number has now grown to more than 400. He’s proud of that, and how the success story in Cranberry Township led to more such facilities being built.

“After this facility opened, we challenged other communities to open their own facilities and, without even asking, I made the assumption that Bob Nutting and Pirates Charities would help fund and support additional facilities and programs -- and they have,” Sherry said. “We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the support of Pirates Charities and Mr. Nutting. From Day One, they’ve been a partner financially, which we need, but they’ve also been a partner in understanding that it takes more than money to make a great program. That’s participating, being engaged and doing events like our fantasy camp here today.”

Saturday’s fantasy camp was the third conducted by the Pirates this year. The others were at the Miracle League of Manasota in Bradenton in February and the Miracle League of Moon Township in July.

One of the parents of a Miracle League athlete enjoying the festivities at Graham Park on Saturday was Jimmy Hogue. His son James -- a huge Andrew McCutchen fan -- has been part of the Cranberry Township program since the beginning, when former Pirates All-Star and National League batting champion Freddy Sanchez was involved.

“James loves baseball and he loves the Pirates,” Hogue said. “He’s a great young man, and he’s been coming here since the beginning when he was about 6 years old, and we got to meet Freddy Sanchez. The Miracle League has been great for James and our whole family. We love the program and we’re thankful that a place like this was brought to our area.”

That’s what it’s all about, and why the Pirates love being a key part of the program.

“It’s incredible to see how the Miracle League has expanded and the families and kids that it’s touched, but my favorite part of the whole program is days like today when we get to help bring the field to life and have fun out here,” Nutting said. “We just love this program, and right here in Cranberry Township is where it all started.”

LONG LIVE THEIR LEGACY
A presentation honoring Negro League Baseball

In honor of Negro League Baseball, the Pirates are proud to present "Long Live Their Legacy" video series.

This video series is designed to help educate young people about the history of Negro League baseball, its ties to Pittsburgh and the significant influence it has had - and still has - on the current game of baseball.

Pittsburgh was a hub for Negro League baseball during the first half of the 20th century and was the only city in the country to host two Negro League teams - the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Those teams were two of the most historic Negro League teams of all time and featured stars such as Josh Gibson, Leroy Robert "Satchel" Paige, James Thomas "Cool Papa" Bell and Buck Leonard.

Coaches, teachers and community leaders are encouraged to share the “Long Live Their Legacy” video series with the youth the work with to help ensure the next generation understands the legacy of the Negro Leagues.

PITTSBURGH'S NEGRO LEAGUE BASEBALL HISTORY
The color line in baseball was drawn in 1887 when African Americans were banned from playing on white teams in the International League. It was 33 years later before disenfranchised black baseball players had a league of their own. Andrew "Rube" Foster, a talented player and visionary who believed that only through organization could Black baseball reach its full potential, formed the Negro National League in 1920.

Created out of adversity, Negro Leagues baseball became the second largest Black business in the nation, second only to Black insurance companies.

Two of the most successful teams to play in the Negro Leagues, the Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords, had their beginnings on the sandlots and playgrounds in the Pittsburgh area.

The Homestead Grays played as independents for much of their early history, with great success. Located first in a small steel town outside of Pittsburgh, the Grays dominated the Eastern baseball scene. They were led by future Hall of Famers Josh Gibson (catcher), "Cool" Papa Bell (outfield), Judy Johnson (third base), Buck Leonard (first base) and Cuban great Martin Dihigo (second base, pitcher, outfielder). Their ace pitcher was "Smokey" Joe Williams, who once struck out 27 batters in a 12-inning game. The Grays spent some of their most successful years, from 1934 through 1948, in the newly reorganized Negro National League. During this time, the Grays won nine consecutive Negro National League pennants, 1939-45, and a tenth in 1948. During World War II, the Grays played their home games at both Forbes Field (Pittsburgh) and Griffith Stadium (Washington, D.C.) when the white Major League clubs were on the road. The Grays traditionally outdrew their white counterparts, the cellar-dwelling Washington Senators.

The Pittsburgh Crawfords also spent their earliest years (1931-32) as independents. The Crawfords joined the newly reorganized Negro National League in 1933 and were immediately recognized as a leading team in the league. Originally, the team was composed of amateurs from the sandlots of the city's Hill district. The Crawfords won the 1935 and 1936 season pennants, and the 1935 club is regarded by many as the greatest Black baseball team of all time, with five future Hall of Famers: James "Cool Papa" Bell, Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson, Judy Johnson and the legendary Satchel Paige.

In Pittsburgh, the Crawfords and the Grays were a source of great pride that offered a cultural counterpoint to the limitations encountered by blacks in the workplace, in society and in politics.

When Jackie Robinson broke the Major League color barrier in 1947, Pittsburgh witnessed the transformation of both the game of baseball and people's perception of a segment of the population unjustly treated as second-class citizens and third-rate ballplayers.

The Pittsburgh Pirates signed their first Black player, Curt Roberts, on April 19, 1954, and on September 1, 1971, the team brought about one of the most significant milestones in the racial history of Major League Baseball when they fielded the first all-Black lineup.

NEGRO LEAGUE PLAYERS INDUCTED INTO PIRATES HALL OF FAME
Pirates Hall of Fame
In 2022, the Pirates unveiled their inaugural Hall of Fame class, which included prominent players from the Negro Leagues. Josh Gibson (Crawfords and Grays), Oscar Charleston (Crawfords and Grays), Ray Brown (Grays), and Buck Leonard (Grays), were all immortalized in Pirates history, and all four are also members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. As part of the ceremony, the organization “signed” Gibson, Charleston, Leonard and Brown to contracts. Signing the deals on behalf of Gibson and Leonard were Sean Gibson (great-grandson) and Rose Fox-Hunter (step-daughter),

All-Minority Lineup Anniversary
On September 1, 1971, the Pirates proudly became the first MLB franchise to field a starting lineup that consisted of all Black and Latino players. The all-minority starting nine broke one of the most significant racial barriers in baseball since Jackie Robinson’s historical Major League debut 24 years prior. The nine players in the lineup were: Rennie Stennett (2B), Gene Clines (CF), Roberto Clemente (RF), Willie Stargell (LF), Manny Sanguillen (C), Dave Cash (3B), Al Oliver (1B), Jackie Hernandez (SS), and Dock Ellis (RHP).

The Pirates celebrated this historic moment in sports history by hosting an in-depth panel discussion Wednesday, September 1 at 6:30 p.m. at the Heinz History Center. The panel featured four members of the historic lineup including Cash, Clines, Oliver and Sanguillen, along with Roberto Clemente Jr. KDKA Radio celebrity Rick Dayton hosted the hour-long discussion.

The Pittsburgh Pirates own a history filled with World Championships, legendary players and some of baseball's most dramatic games.


Roberto Clemente statue in Center Field
The Roberto Clemente statue was dedicated on July 8, 1994, to kick off All-Star Week in Pittsburgh. It was originally erected outside Gate A at Three Rivers Stadium and is now located outside the Center Field Gate to PNC Park, a few steps away from the Roberto Clemente Bridge.

As part of the 50th anniversary season of the 1960 World Series Championship, the 12-foot bronze statue was officially unveiled on September 5, 2010, and stands at the end of Mazeroski Way, which is located at the right field entrance to PNC Park.

At the corner of Mazeroski Way and General Robinson Street, you’ll find:
Honus Wagner statue at the Home Plate entrance
The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park.
The Pittsburgh Pirates own a history filled with World Championships, legendary players and some of baseball's most dramatic games and moments.

Use the timeline to trace Pirates history, from the Waner brothers to Mazeroski's incredible World Series-winning homer; and from the heroics of Clemente and Stargell to the dramatic 2013 Wild Card win. The Pirates' roots in Pittsburgh actually date back to April 15, 1876, when the Pittsburgh Alleghenys brought professional baseball to the city by playing their first game at Union Park. In 1877, the Alleghenys were accepted into the minor-league International Association, but disbanded the following year.

Baseball returned to Pittsburgh for good in 1882 when the Alleghenys reformed and joined the American Association, a rival of the National League. After the 1886 season, the Kansas City franchise was expelled from the N.L. and Pittsburgh President William A. Nimmick's application for membership was accepted.

On April 30, 1887, the Alleghenys defeated the defending league-champion Chicago White Stockings, 6-2, before a crowd of nearly 10,000 at Recreation Park. The victorious beginning was not an indication of things to come, however, as the team managed to finish higher than fifth only once in the 13 remaining seasons of the century. In 1890, the Alleghenys' roster was demolished when key players jumped to a new rival to the National League - the Players League. They staggered to a club-record 113 losses as the two leagues engaged in a bitter battle over talent.

When the Players League folded after only one season, all players were expected to return to the clubs they played for in 1889. But in 1891 Pittsburgh signed Louis Bierbauer, a second baseman with Brooklyn of the Players League who had spent the previous four seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics. The A's and their American Association brethren immediately accused Pittsburgh of "pirating" Bierbauer away from them. Pittsburgh kept the player and the nickname and became known as the Pirates thereafter.

The fortunes of the Pirates turned in 1900 when the National League reduced its membership from 12 to eight teams. As part of the move, Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the defunct Louisville club, acquired controlling interest of the Pirates. In the largest player transaction in Pirates history, the Hall-of-Fame owner brought 14 players with him from the Louisville roster, including Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke and Rube Waddell - plus standouts Deacon Phillippe, Chief Zimmer, Claude Ritchey and Tommy Leach. All would play significant roles as the Pirates became the league's dominant franchise, winning pennants in 1901, 1902 and 1903 and a World championship in 1909.

Wagner, dubbed "The Flying Dutchman," was the game's premier player during the decade, winning seven batting titles and leading the majors in hits (1,850) and RBI (956) from 1900-1909. One of the pioneers of the game, Dreyfuss is sometimes called "The Father of the World Series" because he challenged Henry Killilea, the owner of the American League champion Boston Americans, to a post-season playoff in 1903 to determine who was baseball's best team. On October 1, 1903, Phillippe defeated the legendary Cy Young, 7-3, in the first World Series game ever played. Boston, however, later emerged as the Series winner, overcoming a three-games-to- one deficit to win the best-of-nine competition, five games to three. In the Series, Phillippe started five of the games.

The Pirates finished as runner-up three times in the next five years before getting another shot at a World Series title in 1909. The Bucs won a club-record 110 games that year with three pitchers - Howie Camnitz (25), Vic Willis (22) and Lefty Leifield (19) combining for 66 victories. The Series pitted the league's batting champions - Wagner and Detroit's Ty Cobb against each other, but rookie pitcher Babe Adams, who was 12-3 during the regular season, emerged as the Series hero for the Pirates.

While Camnitz, Willis and Leifield failed to win a game, Adams won three, including a six-hit shutout in the seventh and deciding game. It was the last of four titles the Pirates would win under Clarke, who managed the club until 1915. The 1909 season also marked the beginning of a new era in ballparks as the Pirates christened Forbes Field on June 30 that year. Since 1891, the Pirates had called Exposition Park - which was located on virtually the same site as Three Rivers Stadium - their home. Described as the "Hialeah of Ballparks" when it opened, Forbes Field would remain the home of the Pirates for six decades and would host many great moments.

Pittsburgh sank to the league's second division for most of the next decade, but by the early 1920's - with an influx of outstanding talent which included future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler, Rabbit Maranville and Max Carey - Pittsburgh was again a contender. After three straight third- place finishes from 1922 to 1924, the Pirates won the N.L. title by eight and a half games over the second-place New York Giants in 1925.

The Series matched Pittsburgh against the Washington Senators, who jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead. The Pirates, however, bounced back to win the final three games and the Series. Their miraculous comeback included a 15-hit pounding of Hall of Famer Walter "Big Train" Johnson in Game Seven.

In 1926, a rookie named Paul Waner joined the Bucs and batted .336. A year later, his brother Lloyd joined him and belted out 223 hits for a club rookie record .355 average and the Pirates were again National League champions. Paul, who was nicknamed "Big Poison" - batted .300 or better 14 times, captured three batting titles and collected 200 or more hits in eight different seasons. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player in 1927 and went on to compile 3,152 hits and a .333 career batting average. Lloyd - who was tagged "Little Poison" - hit .300 or better in 10 of his first 12 seasons, compiled a career mark of .316 and accumulated 2,450 hits. Both were elected to the Hall of Fame.

The 1927 World Series featured the Pirates against New York's famed "Murderer's Row" with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, who swept Pittsburgh in four straight games. The next 33 years, Pirate fans went without a pennant winner, although they were not denied their share of great players and great moments.

The Waners were consistently among baseball's premier hitters during the 1930's with Paul amassing more hits (1,959) during the decade than any player in baseball. Traynor was one of the era's best all-around players and is generally regarded as one of the finest third basemen ever to play the game. Shortstop Arky Vaughan topped the .300-mark in each of his 10 seasons with the Pirates (1932-1941) and his .385 average in 1935 has gone unequalled by any National League performer. He, too, is enshrined at Cooperstown.

Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner won or shared the N.L. home run title in each of the seven seasons that he wore a Pirates uniform (1946-52) - which is a streak that has never been matched in either league. In 1956, Pirate first baseman Dale Long hit home runs in a record eight straight games between May 19th and May 28th (that mark was matched by Don Mattingly in 1987 and Ken Griffey Jr. in 1993). Three years later, Harvey Haddix hurled what many consider the greatest game ever pitched when he retired 36 straight Milwaukee Braves hitters over 12 innings on May 26, 1959. The same year, ElRoy Face won 17 straight games in relief.

Though the Pirates failed to finish higher than seventh from 1950 through 1957, the foundation for another championship was being put into place. Standout players were added throughout the decade, including 2001 Hall-of-Fame inductee Bill Mazeroski, Dick Groat, Vernon Law, Bob Friend, Bill Virdon, Face and Hall-of-Fame right fielder Roberto Clemente.

In 1956, Pirate owner John Galbreath hired Joe L. Brown as general manager. With the club languishing in last place at 36-67 midway through the 1957 campaign, Brown promoted coach Danny Murtaugh to field manager. Within three seasons, the Bucs were again champions of the National League and again matched against the powerful New York Yankees in the World Series. This time the Bronx Bombers featured Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.

The 1960 World Series remains one of the most incredible post-season encounters ever on record. The Yankees won Game Two, Game Three and Game Six by a combined score of 38-3, but the Pirates used great pitching, defense and timely hitting to stretch the Series to a seventh game at Forbes Field. Pittsburgh took a 9-7 lead into the ninth - thanks to Hal Smith's three-run homer in the eighth - but the Yankees came up with two runs in the top of the ninth to tie the score. The game and the Series ended, however, in the bottom of the ninth as Mazeroski belted what is perhaps the most dramatic home run in baseball history off Ralph Terry. Mazeroski was the only player in baseball history ever to end a World Series with a home run until Joe Carter of Toronto accomplished the feat in Game Six of the 1993 Fall Classic.

During the 1960's, Clemente established himself among the game's elite players. He collected more hits (1,877) than anyone during the decade and would go on to reach the 3,000-hit plateau in 1972. During his marvelous career, he topped the .300 mark 13 times, won four batting titles and was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1966.

The changing of the decade also brought along a change to the home ballpark of the Pirates. After playing in cavernous Forbes Field since June 30, 1909, the Bucs began play at a multi-purpose stadium located at the confluence of Pittsburgh's three rivers. The aptly named Three Rivers Stadium played host to its first game on July 16, 1970, with the Pirates losing a 3-2 decision to the Reds.

During the 1970's, the Pirates were again among baseball's premier teams. In that 10-year span, they won six division titles and finished as low as third only once. In the first 25 years of divisional play, the Bucs won more games (2,100) and finished first more often (nine times) than any other N.L. East club. The Pirates put together a 2,100-1,878 record during that period (.528 winning %).

The Pirates captured two more World Championships during the 1970's. Their 1971 victory over Baltimore was a showcase for Clemente, who batted .414 and received the Series MVP award.

In 1979, the Pirates became only the fourth team in history to erase a three-games-to-one deficit when they again bested the Orioles in seven games. Hall of Famer Willie Stargell took home MVP honors - as he did during the regular season - with a .400 batting average, three home runs (including the Series' deciding blow in Game Seven) and seven RBI. It was a fitting conclusion to the decade for Stargell, who was the leading home run hitter of the 1970's (296). While the Pirates brought two world championships back to Pittsburgh during the 1970s, the Pittsburgh Steelers also came to prominence. The Steelers won four Super Bowls during the 70s, which, coupled with the Pirates success, helped garner Pittsburgh the "City of Champions" label.

On October 2, 1985, the Galbreath family and Warner Communications sold the club to Pittsburgh Associates; a group of private investors who were committed to keeping the team in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Associates was made up of 10 investors representing
six corporations, three individuals and Carnegie Mellon Univer- sity. The group included the Aluminum Company of America, Mellon Bank, PNC Financial Corporation, PPG Industries, USX Corporation, Westinghouse Electric Company, Eugene and Raymond Litman, John McConnell and Harvey M. Walken.

After several lean years in the mid-eighties, the Pirates returned to contention in 1988 when they finished in second place and broke the club's 28-year-old attendance mark.

With players like Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek, Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke, Pittsburgh started the decade of the 1990's in fine fashion, winning the N.L. East title three straight years. The Bucs became the first team to win three straight division titles since the Philadelphia Phillies accomplished the feat between 1976 and 1978. Bonds captured MVP honors in 1990 and 1992, while Drabek won the Cy Young award in '90. Manager Jim Leyland took home N.L. Manager-of-the-Year honors in both 1990 and 1992. In his 11 seasons at the helm, Leyland won 849 games, placing him third on the club's All-Time Managerial win list.

Pittsburgh was on the brink of a World Series berth in both the 1991 and 1992 season, but the Pirates lost the seventh and deciding game each year to the Atlanta Braves. In 1992, Pittsburgh came within three outs of the Fall Classic. But in the bottom of the ninth inning at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, the Braves triumphed with three runs and won the game 3-2 and the series, four-games-to-three.

The people of Pittsburgh and the surrounding Tri-State area responded well to the club's success in the nineties as the Pirates drew in excess of two million fans in both 1990 and 1991.

A crowd of 59,568, the largest ever to watch a professional baseball game in Pittsburgh, witnessed the 65th Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1994. In one of the most thrilling All-Star Games ever to be played, the National League prevailed over the American League in extra frames. Fred McGriff helped send the game into extra innings when he delivered a two-run, pinch- hit home run off Lee Smith in the bottom of the ninth inning that tied the score. After the American League failed to score in the top of the 10th inning, the National League broke its six-game losing streak when Tony Gwynn scored on a double by Moises Alou.

A new chapter of Pirate history began on February 14, 1996, when Kevin McClatchy and his group of investors purchased the storied franchise from Pittsburgh Associates.

Picked by many publications to finish last in 1997, the Pirates remained in the division race until the final weekend of the season and the club was named USA Today's "Organization of the Year" at the conclusion of the season. Major League Baseball also
underwent a change in 1997 with the birth of Interleague play. That season, the Pirates welcomed the Kansas City Royals to Three Rivers Stadium on June 13 for the club's first interleague matchup, which Pittsburgh won by a score of 5-3.

While the Bucs contended for the division during the entire 1997 season, one of the most memorable moments of the season came on July 12. That night, pitchers Francisco Cordova and Ricardo Rincon thrilled Pirates fans with the only combined, extra-inning no-hitter in major league history. The game ended in the bottom of the 10th inning when Mark Smith delivered a three-run home run for the 3-0 win.

The 2000 season brought an end to a full century of great moments, a 100-year period which began with three straight National League pennants and ended with an aura of hope and dreams of more championships to come. With a new home on the horizon, the Bucs said goodbye to Three Rivers Stadium with their final game ever played there on October 1, 2000. Three no-hitters, Clemente's 3000th hit, two All-Star Games, countless playoff games, two World Championships and endless summer evenings can be associated with no other place in the history of Pittsburgh than Three Rivers Stadium.

The Pirates closed out their 30-year tenure at Three Rivers Stadium with a 10-9 loss to the Chicago Cubs in the final game of what was the club's home since 1970. Pittsburgh native John Wehner smacked the final home run in the history of the ballpark off Chicago's Jon Lieber. Ironically, Wehner also grounded out to third base for the final out ever at Three Rivers. With the loss, Pittsburgh closed out Three Rivers Stadium with a record of 1,324 wins and 1,082 losses.

In the early morning of February 11, 2001, Pittsburgh bid farewell to Three Rivers when the home of the Pirates and Steelers was imploded.PNC Park officially opened its gates on April 9, 2001. Regarded by many as the best ballpark ever built, PNC Park is an intimate two-level structure which offers all fans dramatic views of the downtown skyline as well as the natural grass playing surface. After touring all 30 major league ballparks during the summer of 2003, ESPN.com ranked PNC Park as the best in baseball.

The anticipation and joy of a new ballpark turned to sorrow, when on the morning of the first regular season game at PNC Park, a beloved member of the Pirates family was lost when Willie Stargell passed away on April 9, 2001.

Despite suffering 100 losses for just the seventh time in club history in 2001, fans came out in record numbers as the Bucs played in front of 19 sellouts and a total of 2,436,139 customers during the inaugural season at PNC Park.

On June 25, 2002, the Pirates registered the 9,000th win in the history of the franchise with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Expos, thus becoming just the fourth club to produce 9,000 wins.

The Pirates have had a long list of sluggers in their history and Brian Giles added his name to that list during his five seasons in a Bucco uniform. He hit 30 or more home runs in each of his first four seasons with the club, just one of three Pirates to hit 30 or more long balls in four consecutive years (also Hall-of-Famers Ralph Kiner and Willie Stargell). His 165 home runs with Pittsburgh rank seventh in club history.

Catcher Jason Kendall spent each of his first nine big league seasons in a Pittsburgh uniform after being selected in the first round of the 1992 June draft. In that time, he made 1,205 appearances behind the plate. That figure ranks first all-time in the annals of the club, 50 games ahead of George Gibson, who caught for the Bucs from 1906 thru 1915. Kendall surpassed Gibson's 90-year-old record in Los Angeles on August 3, 2004.

For the first time in team history a Pittsburgh player captured Rookie-of-the-Year honors as outfielder Jason Bay took home the honors in 2004. A two-time National League All-Star, Bay was a fan favorite at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh.

The national spotlight shined once again on the city of Pittsburgh during the 2006 season as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at PNC Park, marking the fifth time the event has been held in the Steel City. The American League won a dramatic 3-2 decision in the Midsummer Classic as the Pirates became the first team in baseball history to host the All-Star Game in three different venues.

Also in 2006, Freddy Sanchez added his name to the club's record list of 25 batting champions as his .344 average led the National League. Sanchez banged out 200 hits in 2006 and led the N.L. with 53 doubles while being named to his first of two All-Star teams.

On January 18, 2007, Bob Nutting officially assumed control of the ballclub, thus becoming only the sixth principal owner in the Pirates storied history. Following a deep look into the team's operations, Nutting has built a fundamentally different
organization by introducing Frank Coonelly as the team's new president on September 13, 2007 and, in-turn, Neal Huntington as the team's new general manager on September 25, 2007. From there the new leadership team has made significant changes to each of the three major areas - Major League manager/coaching staff, Scouting Director and Farm Director, with the goal of building an organization that can consistently compete.

Since 2009, fans have witnessed the debuts of many first-round draft picks, including Andrew McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Neil Walker, Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon along with appearances of many other young players, including Starling Marte, Gregory Polanco and Josh Bell.

Clint Hurdle was named manager of the Pirates on November 15, 2010, and in his first seven seasons at the helm, the inspirational leader of the club has posted a 584-549-1 record while leading the Bucs to the postseason three times.

During the 2012 campaign, Bucco fans showed their great support of the club as the Pirates played host to 17 sellouts during the season.

McCutchen also emerged as one of the best players in the game, winning a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award in 2012 while finishing third in the National League MVP voting.

In 2013 the Pirates returned to prominence in the league as they won 94 regular season games and appeared in the postseason for the first time since 1992.

The Pirates placed five players on the 2013 All-Star team - the most since also having five selected to the 1972 Midsummer Classic. Along with McCutchen, Pedro Alvarez, Jason Grilli, Jeff Locke and Mark Melancon represented the Bucs at the 2013 All-Star Game, played at Citi Field in New York.

Led by 16-game winner and the National League Comeback Player-of-the-Year Francisco Liriano, the Bucco pitching staff posted 16 shutouts in 2013 and ranked third in the N.L. with a 3.26 ERA; the best mark by the pitching staff since 1984. Grilli (33) and Melancon (16) picked up 49 of the club-record and National League leading 55 saves.

The offense was led by McCutchen, who took home N.L. MVP honors in 2013 after hitting .317 with 97 runs, 38 doubles, 21 home runs, 84 RBI and 27 stolen bases in 157 games. McCutchen became the sixth player in club history to win the MVP award, joining Dick Groat (1960), Roberto Clemente (1966), Dave Parker (1978), Willie Stargell (1979) and Barry Bonds (1990, 1992).

Silver Slugger award winner Pedro Alvarez shared the league lead in home runs in 2013, as the young slugger smacked 36 long balls to become the first Bucco to lead or share the N.L. lead in homers since Willie Stargell did so with 44 in 1973.

After winning 94 games during the 2013 regular season and finishing second in the N.L. Central division standings, the Pirates defeated the Reds in the Wild Card playoff game, played before a sold out crowd at PNC Park on October 1. The game would officially launch the kickoff to Buctober for years to come. The Pirates had a two-games-to-one lead in the best of five Division Series playoff against the Cardinals, but dropped the final two games to bring an end to their magical 2013 campaign.

The Pirates produced a record 23 sellouts during the 2013 regular season before playing in front of three standing-room only crowds in the postseason.

Clint Hurdle also took home some hardware following the 2013 season as he was named the N.L. Manager-of-the Year; just the second Bucco skipper to win the award.

The Pirates reached the postseason again in 2014 while drawing 2,442,564 fans and averaging 30,155 for their 81 home dates. In addition, the Bucs posted 23 regular season sellouts for the second consecutive year.

With a combination of the second-best OBP in the National League (.333) and a pitching staff that posted the second- lowest ERA (2.94) over the final two months of the season, the Pirates won 88 games in 2014, finishing 2.0 games behind St. Louis in the Central division race.

Josh Harrison finished second in the N.L. batting race while Andrew McCutchen once again put up MVP-type numbers, leading the Pirates to the postseason in back-to-back seasons for just the sixth time in franchise history.

The final game of the 2014 season was played on October 1 as a standing-room only crowd of 40,629 watched eventual World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner shut down the Bucs in the Wild Card Game as the Giants began their run toward the championship.

For the sixth time in franchise history, and for the first time since 1991, the Pirates won 98 games in a season as the 2015 squad posted a 98-64 record. The Pirates also established a club-record attendance figure in 2015, drawing 2,498,596 fans and averaging 30,847 fans for their 81 home dates. The Bucs went 53-28 at home, setting a record for most wins in a season at PNC Park.

During the 2015 campaign, Pittsburgh posted its 10,000th franchise win on September 24, becoming the fifth club to record as many victories.

For the third straight year the Pirates hosted the N.L. Wild Card Game in 2015, making the postseason three consecutive years for just the fourth time in team history.

Mark Melancon set a club record and led the Major Leagues with 51 saves in 2015. In addition, Gerrit Cole won 19 games, Starling Marte captured a Gold Glove Award for his fielding excellence and Korean import Jung Ho Kang was a finalist for N.L. Rookie- of-the-Year.

The 2017 season saw the emergence of another young talented player as Josh Bell set a National League record for most home runs hit by a switch-hitting rookie (26).

Bell placed his name in the record books during the 2019 season, putting up one of the best offensive months in MLB history. The N.L. All-Star hit .390 with 12 homers, 31 RBI and a 1.238 OPS in May while setting the club record for most total bases (94) in a month. He also became just the third National League player in history to produce at least 12 doubles and 12 home runs in any calendar month.

Derek Shelton was named the 41st manager in team history on November 27, 2019 while Ben Cherington took over General Manager duties - the 13th GM in Pirates history - prior to the 2020 campaign.

The 2020 season was shortened to 60 games due to the international COVID-19 pandemic. Travel was also limited as the Pirates played teams only from the N.L. and A.L. Central divisions.

For the 50th time in club history, a Gold Glove award was given to a Pirates player as Jacob Stallings took home the hardware for his catching excellence in 2021.

A total of 25 rookies appeared in at least one game for the Bucs in 2022 and combined for a club-record 56 home runs, led by Jack Suwinski (19) and Oneil Cruz (17).

In 2023, Mitch Keller set the club record for most strikeouts by a right-handed pitcher (210) while third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes captured a Gold Glove award - the first won by a Pittsburgh player at that position.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh. The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division. Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game.

The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente, the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell.

Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[5] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[6] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839–10,819–140 (.500 winning 'percentage').[7]

The Pirates are also often referred to as the "Bucs" or the "Buccos" (derived from buccaneer, a synonym for pirate). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park, a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side. The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins.

History
Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates
Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season.[8] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10] the team was listed as "Allegheny" in the standings, and was sometimes called the "Alleghenys" (rarely the "Alleghenies") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.[11]

Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was "piratical".[12] This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly "piratical" act gained them the occasional nickname "Pirates" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers.[13] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.

After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels, who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)[14] Among those players was Honus Wagner, who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played, which they lost to Boston. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field.

As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925, becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series.[15] The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season.

Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960. They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2022, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.

Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971. Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.[16] Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, and 1979. Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Al Oliver, the team was nicknamed "The Lumber Company." Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song "We Are Family" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).

The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, and Doug Drabek. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.


Andrew McCutchen, 2012
With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen, defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game. They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time wins.[17] On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th[18] making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs.[19] The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.

Ballpark
Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park, located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium, a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics.[20] Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services.[21] PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game, when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4–0.


PNC Park prior to a game in 2014
Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.[22][23][24][25] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;[26] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,[27] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts.

PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge, or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.

Former ballparks
The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season.[28] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.[29] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series.


Forbes Field, the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970
In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation.[30] Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss "hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field.[31] When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected.[32][33][34] Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth's career on May 25, 1935[35] and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh "Pitt" Panthers. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall.[36][37]

The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium. In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit.[38]


LECOM Park, which hosts the Pirates' Spring Training games
Spring Training
Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach, which dates to 1914.[39] It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park, built in 1912, and Wrigley Field, built in 1914.[40] Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights.[41] The park was formerly named "McKechnie Field," for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in 1925; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton.[42] Pirate City, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park.



Uniform design in the 1940s
The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the "P" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century.[43] During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple "P" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had "Pirates" running vertically down the placket.[43] The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and "Pittsburgh" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.[43]

In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic "Red, White, & Blue" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924,[44][45][46] but the change did not last beyond that season.[47][48] Along with the San Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an "accent color" in 1997 and remained until 2009.

In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit).[43] The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.

In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons.[43] The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys, following the Oakland Athletics. Starting in 1977, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold "P" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.[43]

After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold "P" at both home and on the road.[43] From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.[49]

Since the 2015 season, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games.[50] The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.[51]

Ahead of the 2020 season, the Pirates revived the script "Pittsburgh" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the "P" logo outlined in black and yellow.[52] In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold "P", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.

In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new "4+1" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold "P" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh "PGH". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted "Y", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous "Steelmark" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh.[53]

Rivalries
Philadelphia Phillies
Main article: Phillies–Pirates rivalry
The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994.[54][55][56] It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies.[57]

The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.[56][58][59] The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[58]

After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[55][56] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry.[60]

Cincinnati Reds
Main article: Pirates-Reds rivalry
The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason,[61] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls.[62]

Divisional foes
From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious[63] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of the 1938 season.

Interleague
The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers. While the Pirates and Tigers only became "natural rivals" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series.

An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically. The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new "balanced" schedule. The Pirates lead the series 21–18.[64]

Pirates Hall of Fame
In 2022, the Pirates formally established a team Hall of Fame to honor the "most influential ballplayers in Pittsburgh baseball history", as picked by an internal committee that had the help of team historian Jim Trdinich.[65][66] 19 individuals were part of the first class, which included every Pittsburgh Pirate inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame along with several other former players, broadcasters, and coaches. Like the Washington Nationals with the Ring of Honor, the Pirates inducted players that had played for the Negro league baseball team Homestead Grays, which had played in Forbes Field and Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh alongside their time in Washington; two of the first class also spent time with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, with a ceremony dedicated to "signing" the four to Pirates contracts. All inductees were honored with a plaque displayed in the concourse by the entrance with the statue of Roberto Clemente.[67][68]

First-in-MLB accomplishments

Chief Wilson set the MLB all-time record for triples in a single season in 1912 with 36.
On May 8, 1886, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys turned the first 3–4–2 triple play in Major League history.[83] In the fourth inning of a game, the Cincinnati Red Stockings put runners in first and second with no outs. John Reilly grounded out to first base, where Fred Carroll recorded the first out. He threw to second base, where Sam Barkley made the tag for the second out. The runner from second decided to try for home plate and he was cut down on a throw from Barkley and a tag by Doggie Miller.[citation needed] The Alleghenys won the game, 9–6.[84]
First ever Major League Baseball game broadcast on the radio, a game between the Pirates and the host Philadelphia Phillies aired August 5, 1921, on KDKA (AM) Pittsburgh. The Pirates won the game, 8–5.
In 1925, the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3-games-to-1 deficit in winning a best-of-seven World Series; they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat in 1979.[85][86]
During the 1953 season, the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass "miner's cap". This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game.[87] In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap.[88] The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only Alex Torres of the New York Mets choosing to wear it.[89]
First franchise to win a World Series on a home run (1960 World Series) in the 7th game. The only other team to accomplish this feat is the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, though theirs came in Game 6.
In 1970 the Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton-nylon blend featuring pull-over shirts and beltless pants.[90]
The first all-minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1, 1971.[91] The lineup was Rennie Stennett, Gene Clines, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Manny Sanguillén, Dave Cash, Al Oliver, Jackie Hernández, and Dock Ellis.[92]
The first World Series night game was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13, 1971—eleven years to the day since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960. In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good things happen for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the 1971 World Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title.
The first MLB scout to win the "Scout of the Year Award", Howie Haak, in 1984, three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award.
The first combined extra inning no-hitter in MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1997. Francisco Córdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rincón (1 inning) combined to no-hit the Houston Astros, 3–0 in 10 innings. Pinch-hitter Mark Smith's three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no-hitter for the Pirates. It remains the only such no-hitter to date.[93]
In November 2008, the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non-draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel.[94][95] This was also seen by Pirates general manager Neal Huntington, as "not only add[ing] two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market."[96]
The Pirates are the first team in professional sports to have 20 consecutive losing seasons. This streak lasted from 1993 to 2012. This is the longest such streak in North American professional sports history.
The Pirates are the first MLB team (as well as only second in major professional sports) to be owned by an openly gay owner, although Kevin McClatchy had already divested his shares in the Pirates when he openly announced his homosexuality in September 2012.[97][98]
On April 6, 2015, the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati Reds earned the team its 10,000 franchise loss and making the Pirates the first MLB team to reach their 10,000th loss on an Opening Day.[18]
On May 9, 2015, the Pirates became the first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The triple play occurred during a 7–5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The play occurred when the Cardinals' Yadier Molina lined out to Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker. Walker then threw to third baseman Jung Ho Kang to double off the Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who was standing on second base for the final out after St. Louis's Jason Heyward froze between second and third.[99]
On April 24, 2017, the Pirates fielded the first baseball player to be born and raised in Lithuania, to reach the major leagues, Dovydas Neverauskas. In 1933, Joe Zapustas was the first Lithuanian-born player to play in MLB, as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics, however, he grew up in Boston.[100]
On April 26, 2017, the Pirates promoted South African Gift Ngoepe from the AAA Indianapolis Indians; making him the first African-born player in MLB history.[101]
On August 23, 2017, the Pirates became the first team in MLB history to break up a no-hitter in extra innings with a walk-off home run. The home run was hit by Josh Harrison in the tenth inning, off of pitcher Rich Hill, to give the Pirates a 1–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.[102]

Civil rights advocacy
Throughout the 1940s Pirates owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club.[104]

The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.[105]

On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history.[106]

Fanbase

Bing Crosby co-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977.
Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin,[107] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams.[108] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century.

While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[109] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[110] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[111] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[112]

When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.

Community activities
Each year, the Pirates recognize six "Community Champions" during a special pregame ceremony.[113]

Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, "Ask Pirates Management", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot. Piratefest was once held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh[114] but is now held annually at the ballpark.

Media

Radio and TV

Map of Pirate radio affiliates
The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921. Harold Arlin, a foreman at Westinghouse, announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field.[115][116] KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with Rosey Rowswell becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936.[117] Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games.

In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM talk radio station WPGB. The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.[118]

On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM,[119] which became official on October 12.[120] On March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM.[121] As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with Pittsburgh Panthers football and men's basketball.[122]

Games are televised on SportsNet Pittsburgh, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network NESN.[123] During the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7.22 rating and 83,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts.[124] Apart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously, KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games also aired on WPXI (1995–1996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997–2002).

Announcers
Current

The Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk, both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst,[125] while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers.[126] Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps, Kevin Young, and Neil Walker.

Past

Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter, usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955.[127] Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team.[128][129] Nicknamed "The Gunner," Prince was known for his "Gunnerisms"—nicknames and quips—and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC.

Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince.[130] Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett, who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015.[131]

Former analysts include Don Hoak, Nelson Briles, and Jim Rooker. Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass, who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.[132]

The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports
The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words "Myron Cope's Terrible Towel" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, "thanks to the Towel."

In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to "Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the "World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave," reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as "Steelers Nation." The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar "Cope-isms" like "Yoi!" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, "Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history, fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

Insider's Guide to the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum
Relive 90 years of Steelers history with interactive exhibits for all fans of the black and gold

Just opened at the end of 2022, the brand new Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is a spectacle, encapsulating 90 years of Steelers history and nearly 50 Hall of Honor inductees across 10,000 square feet of Acrisure Stadium.

My first impression was shock at just how massive the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is. Guests enter via the B Suite gates right next to the Pro Shop, and the stage is set by a stadium seating hype video before turning guests loose into the museum proper. Long corridors twist and turn through rare artifacts, many on display for the first time, as well as retellings and recreations of the biggest moments of the team.

Here's just a few reasons why this museum is a must-see Only in Pittsburgh attraction.

A Complete Steelers History
When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team.

The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome.

In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again.

Jump, Cheer and Yell with Interactive Exhibits
With three energetic kids, a stuffy, quiet museum is not an option. Luckily, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is family-friendly and perfect for even the most boisterous fans on game day. Interactive displays let guests select the era they're interested in, scroll timelines of important events and re-live impactful moments like one section dedicated entirely to the Immaculate Reception.

Think you can outdo Myron Cope? Enter the broadcast booth and pick a classic play which you can then do commentary on! At the end, the display plays back video and audio of how you did, which is sure to bring lots of laughs.

Near the end of the Museum, interactive displays let you measure up to the Steelers, encouraging you to run out of the entrance tunnel and jump as high as you can just like you're taking the field at Acrisure to a raucous crowd.


Honoring Steelers Legends
After you're done viewing all six Super Bowl rings, the final part of the exhibit is perhaps the true highlight. A massive wall of bronzed footballs enshrines each member of the Hall of Honor, with multiple displays that let you select a person, scroll through a timeline of their life and play videos of some of their most memorable moments.

Diehard Steelers fans, you can easily spend an hour or two just in this room. With new members added yearly (and hopefully a new Super Bowl ring to add soon), there's a new reason to tour the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum each season.

What to Eat at PNC Park
​Spending the day watching baseball at PNC Park is a real treat.

Speaking of treats...eating at PNC Park is a culinary adventure! It's part of the whole ballgame experience.

Here are some suggestions that go beyond peanuts and cracker jacks, AND check out some of our favorite ballgame traditions here.

NEW FOR 2024
Hot Dogs & Wursts Galore 🌭
PNC Park has gone all in on the ballpark staple with three new upscale versions of this easy-to-eat snack all available at different locations. The Renegade Hot Dog (Section 133: order it at the kiosks in Pop's Plaza with the Cannonball Burger and crab fries) is going to be an instant Yinzer classic: this footlong is piled with pot roast, mini pierogi, pickles and onions for a fantastic taste of Pittsburgh's food passion contained in a single bite.

Other new additions here including the Pitt Dog (Section 135) that's topped with capicola, vinegar slaw and provolone cheese from the popular Deli Dogs stand, and an amazing looking cheddar and chive brat with classic toppings of peppers, onions and mustard.

The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created?
More From Local Restaurants 🌽
It's corn! LowKey Taco (Section 138) continues to expand their menu offerings this year at their Nachorita stand, adding roasted corn on the cob (such a great addition to snack on as you watch the game), birria beef nachos and even some sweet caramel churros to make this stand a must-stop in 2024. Keep walking around the outfield to Section 144 and find Coop de Ville's all-new chicken biscuit! This is already my go-to stop in the stadium, but adding on a flaky biscuit and house pickles to their already incredible chicken is going to be even better.

Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack
Dessert Pierogi? Dessert Pierogi! 🍨 🥟
Yeah, you read that right. Cannonball Burger (Section 146) is adding a sweet version of this Pittsburgh staple, starting with sweet cheese stuffed dumplings and smothering them in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. If it's a hit, expect sweet pierogi to start popping up all over the city!

PNC PARK FAVORITES
Manny's BBQ
Left Field

This newly remodeled barbecue stand is named after former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen, who has been known to hang around and sign autographs for fans. Eagle-eyed snack connoisseurs will note the new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chicken

On the menu: house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw

Chicken on the Hill & Cannonball Burger
Right Field

Two local Pittsburgh restaurants (Coop De Ville and Station) helped inspire the menus at these spots, and both are located right near seats and tables along the outfield wall to sit and enjoy your meal.

On the menu: Nashville hot chicken sandwich, double ranch burgers, big mozz cheese sticks, plant burgers

Pop's Plaza
Section 132

Be sure to take advantage of all the new improvements in this section of the ballpark. The tech here allows you to get everything delicious here in one place, with kiosks to order from one central location and get your crab fries, ballpark burgers and more.

On the menu: Chickie's & Pete's Crabfries (get extra cheese, dipping these things gets addictive), burgers


Primanti Bros.
Section 108

You can't go wrong with a Primanti's sandwich piled high with fresh deli meats and cheeses and topped off with French fries and cole slaw. A true Pittsburgh classic. Just around the corner from this booth is Wings & Things by Caliente, another regional favorite selling buckets of fresh wings and boneless wings.

First-timers read this: The Pitts-Burger is the go-to order here, which will be a ground beef patty, coleslaw and fries all piled on freshly-baked white bread.

Fat Head's Bullpen Bar
Center Field

It's easy to find good beer throughout the park (North Country's Fireman's Red is my go-to during game day), but the Bullpen Bar specifically features the flavors brewed right here in the city including rotating favorites from Threadbare, Cinderlands, Aslin and other top-notch pours.

The Market
Section 118 (Home Plate)

Try something on the healthier side at this grab-and-go space. The quinoa salad is a filling and delicious alternative to hot dogs and loaded with peppers, tomatoes and a balsamic dressing.

On the menu: Grab-n-go salads, vegan bruschetta wrap

Deli Dogs & Nachoritas
Sections 135 and 137

For me, hot dogs are the quintessential ballpark food. Find the best in the park as you head to the bottom of the rotunda in left field and head towards center field.

On the menu: chili, classic and Chicago-style dogs inspired by local Smallman Street Deli

Sweet Spot
Behind Section 106

Treat yourself to a helmet cookie sundae, served just as it says with a fresh baked cookie on top of ice cream in a souvenir helmet sundae bowl. No Pittsburgh home is complete without a few of these on hand.

Caliente Pizza
Sections 113-114, 123, 313, 304

Already a fan favorite at other Pittsburgh stadiums, Caliente Pizza & Draft House is serving up giant slices of Sicilian, pepperoni and cheese pizza to fans at PNC Park. Find them throughout the ballpark at concessions sections in sections 113-114, 123, 313 and 304. Plus, they also now run the Wings & Things stand next to Primantis for your fix of giant buckets of mouthwatering wings.

Cinderlands Corner Bar
Bottom of the left field rotunda

Easily the best kept secret in the park right now, but one I'm happy to share. Head to the bottom of the left field rotunda, keep walking around to the back of the structure and grab the best beer in the park direct from Cinderlands.

Cans Available: Raise It, Squish, Lil Cinder Lime, Full Squish

If these aren't enough for you, check out these unique offerings at PNC Park, or head to a ball game soon for great baseball and a smorgasbord of food choices! What is your favorite food to eat during a Pirates game?

Insider's Guide to the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum
Relive 90 years of Steelers history with interactive exhibits for all fans of the black and gold

Just opened at the end of 2022, the brand new Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is a spectacle, encapsulating 90 years of Steelers history and nearly 50 Hall of Honor inductees across 10,000 square feet of Acrisure Stadium.

My first impression was shock at just how massive the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is. Guests enter via the B Suite gates right next to the Pro Shop, and the stage is set by a stadium seating hype video before turning guests loose into the museum proper. Long corridors twist and turn through rare artifacts, many on display for the first time, as well as retellings and recreations of the biggest moments of the team.

Here's just a few reasons why this museum is a must-see Only in Pittsburgh attraction.

A Complete Steelers History
When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team.

The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome.

In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again.

Jump, Cheer and Yell with Interactive Exhibits
With three energetic kids, a stuffy, quiet museum is not an option. Luckily, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is family-friendly and perfect for even the most boisterous fans on game day. Interactive displays let guests select the era they're interested in, scroll timelines of important events and re-live impactful moments like one section dedicated entirely to the Immaculate Reception.

Think you can outdo Myron Cope? Enter the broadcast booth and pick a classic play which you can then do commentary on! At the end, the display plays back video and audio of how you did, which is sure to bring lots of laughs.

Near the end of the Museum, interactive displays let you measure up to the Steelers, encouraging you to run out of the entrance tunnel and jump as high as you can just like you're taking the field at Acrisure to a raucous crowd.


Honoring Steelers Legends
After you're done viewing all six Super Bowl rings, the final part of the exhibit is perhaps the true highlight. A massive wall of bronzed footballs enshrines each member of the Hall of Honor, with multiple displays that let you select a person, scroll through a timeline of their life and play videos of some of their most memorable moments.

Diehard Steelers fans, you can easily spend an hour or two just in this room. With new members added yearly (and hopefully a new Super Bowl ring to add soon), there's a new reason to tour the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum each season.

Plan Your Visit
Ready to tour? The Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is open Wednesday-Monday from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. and passes can be booked online. Tours happen on the hour and the last tour of the day begins at 3 p.m. Please Note: The museum will be closed on University of Pittsburgh home games.

Tours last about one hour, and all guests receive 10% off the Steelers Pro Shop on the bottom floor when they present their passes.

Passes are $18 for adults, $15 for seniors/military, $12 for kids 6-17 and free for 5 and under. Group tours are also available.

Roberto Clemente, Pittsburgh's Hero!
Pittsburgh's biggest baseball legend is Roberto Clemente and his impact on baseball and on Pittsburgh still remain.

The Pittsburgh Pirates celebrate Roberto Clemente Day away at the Mets Sept. 15, 2022.

In 2023, all 30 MLB teams will play on Roberto Clemente Day Sept. 15, 2023, including the Pirates hosting the Yankees at PNC Park .

Twenty-One. To some this is just a number. To Pittsburgh and the baseball community, that number is a legacy. On any given day you can walk down the street and see people sporting the number 21 on their backs, from kids to Moms, Dads, Grandpas and Grandmas. It is a Pittsburgh tradition: The famous Pirates Right Fielder Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker wore the number 21.

50th Anniversary of Clemente's 3000th Hit
2022 is a massive year Clemente's legacy. The city of Pittsburgh, Major League Baseball and his home country of Puerto Rico will all celebrate the 50th anniversary of Clemente's 3,000th hit with celebrations, special exhibits, statues, films and more.

In the city, make plans to visit The Clemente Museum now through the end of the year for a brand new display. As soon as you enter, you'll see a giant scoreboard commemorating this iconic moment, with a video showing the hit flanked by gigantic photos taken by the two photographers covering the game that day. Insider Tip: Take special note of the rightmost bat laying on the baseball diamond to the left of the exhibit. That's the legendary bat Clemente used for this tremendous achievement.


On Thursday, Sept. 8, the Clemente Museum will also host their Annual Fundraiser. Support the amazing work this museum does for the Pittsburgh community through your donations and look for limited edition bottles from Engine House 25 Wine, exclusive auctions and more great ways to contribute.

Also worth checking out is Roberto Clemente: Keeping the Dream Alive, a new feature and documentary from TribLive about the challenges facing Clemente's legacy and the importance of his impact generationally in Puerto Rico.

Play
Roberto Clemente's History
Clemente was born in Puerto Rico, and was the youngest of his seven siblings. He developed an interest for baseball during his youth when playing ball with neighboring kids. His love and talent for the sport led him to be recruited to play softball with the Sello Rojo team playing shortstop. By the young age of 16 he was already playing in Puerto Rico's amateur league. He began his professional career when he signed with the Cangrejeros de Santurce in 1952, during the season the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of their Triple-A affiliates.

So began his famous American baseball career. He moved to Montreal to play with the Royals. At the time, he barely spoke any English and was assisted by infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black.

Play
Clemente and the Pittsburgh Pirates
He finally debuted on the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 17th, 1955. At first, he didn't sport the famous 21. He wore the number 13. When it came time to change his number, he picked 21 because there are 21 letters in his full name: 'Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker'.

In the 1960 season Clemente led the league in batting averages and led the Pirates to a 95-59 record year, winning the NL pennant. He and his teammates defeated the New York Yankees in a long seven game series, Clemente with a batting average of .310. He earned a sport on the NL All-Star roster after his performance.

Then came the 1970 season, the last year of baseball that would ever be played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium. In the final game at the field on June 28th, 1970, Clemente felt very emotional about the moving of stadiums, stating that "I spent half my life there."


To honor Clemente the Pirates declared July 24, 1970 as "Roberto Clemente Night". Tons of his Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium wearing their Clemente gear. The Pirates held a ceremony where Clemente received a scroll of 300,000 signatures from Puerto Rico with thousands of dollars being donated to charity work, at the request of Roberto Clemente. This season the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were eventually eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds.

The following season, Clemente lead the Prates to another World Series beating the Orioles. He received the World Series' Most Valuable Player Award after his amazing efforts.

In Clemente's final baseball season of his life he recorded his 3,000th hit in the 4th inning of the September 30th, 1972 game against the New York Mets. This would be his last regular season at-bat hit. His final game was October 11th, 1972 against the Cincinnati Red's.

Why Pittsburgh Loves Roberto Clemente
Clemente was not only known for his baseball talent, he was also known for giving back to the community. He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed.

Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero. They have an award named after him "The Clemente Award" that is presented to the player who "best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement".

Roberto Clemente not only shaped the game of baseball, he shaped Pittsburgh and Puerto Rico. He supported his Latino community and Pittsburgh community with full efforts.

Five Ways to Celebrate Roberto Clemente in Pittsburgh:
Visit the Roberto Clemente Museum and indulge in some "Clemente Label" wine
Take a stroll across the Roberto Clemente Bridge
Catch a Pirates game and grab a photo with the Roberto Clemente Statue outside of PNC Park
Experience the "Beat 'Em Bucs" exhibit at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center
Pick Roberto Clemente out of a lineup of the "Legends of Pittsburgh", a mural highlighting the 'Burgh's all time best baseball players.

Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famers
A look at the City of Champions' recent honors with Hall of Fame enshrinements and retired numbers.

When you play and win for the Steelers, you are celebrated for life. We're taking a look at some of the recent inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, who is on the horizon with Hall of Fame ambitions and the full list of Steelers Hall of Famers below.

You can celebrate these Pro Football Hall of Famers and other Pittsburgh greats in the City of Champions all year long.

The Steelers recently opened their own Hall of Honor to recognize all the great contributors to this historic franchise. From the Immaculate Reception monument and photo ops with The Chief outside Acrisure Stadium to a visit to the Western PA Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center, there is no shortage of ways to experience Steelers history in Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductees
2021 Class:
Five members of the Pittsburgh Steelers were enshrined at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021. Pittsburgh legends Bill Cowher, Donnie Shell and Troy Polamalu were honored with the Centennial Class of 2020. Alan Faneca and Bill Nunn were honored with the 2021 class. The celebrations took place at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio.

Alan Faneca joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1998 and enjoyed a 206-game career in the three rivers city. Faneca started 14 playoff games, including four AFC championship games and a Steelers victory in Super Bowl XL. One of the best offensive linemen in franchise history, Faneca was a six-time, first-team All-Pro during his years with the Steelers; he was voted to nine Pro Bowls overall.


Legendary journalist and Steelers scout Bill Nunn was recognized with a video tribute as the first Black Contributor in the 100-year history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nunn served 18 years as Pittsburgh’s assistant personnel director, then 23 years as a semiretired scout. Nunn also was inducted into the Black College Hall of Fame in 2010.

Today's player is former NFL offensive guard Alan Faneca. Faneca was drafted with the 26th overall pick in 1998 by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and stayed with them until 2007. From 2008-2009 he played for the Jets and in 2010 he finished his career with the Arizona Cardinals. He made 9 Pro Bowls and 6 first team All Pros in his career and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in February.

@pastrypressnfl
2020 Class:
Pittsburgh native Bill Cowher was the head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons from 1992 to 2006. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first team ever to win nine road games and the first sixth-seeded team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl, defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10, in Super Bowl XL.

Donnie Shell joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1974 as a free agent. Shell capped his career with 51 interceptions, becoming the first strong safety in the history of the National Football League to surpass the 50-interception mark. His 51 career interceptions rank him third in Steelers history behind Hall of Famer Mel Blount (57) and Jack Butler (52).

Troy Polamalu spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Polamalu was a defensive leader who guided the Steelers to seven playoff appearances, five division titles and helped them win two of their three most-recent Super Bowl appearances – XL and XLIII.

Names To Watch for the Future
Ben Roethlisberger: Kind of obvious, right? He was the Steelers starting QB, and the face of a historic franchise, for 18 years. He’s threw for over 63,000 yards and 417 touchdowns. His overall record is 165-81-1 and he’s been in six Pro Bowls. Steelers fans’ favorite Ben stat? He won two Super Bowls. He will be eligible for the HOF in 2027 and has a shot at getting in on his first try.
Maurkice Pouncey: Big Ben’s right-hand man, Center Maurkice Pouncey made the 2010s All-Decade Team. He is a 9x Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro selection. He'll be eligible for the HOF starting in 2026.
Art Rooney Jr. and Buddy Parker: Both were finalists in the 2023 class. Rooney Jr. has been with the Steelers from 1965 to this day. He was the Steelers Personnel Director until 1985 and played a pivotal rule in crafting the Steelers 70s Super Bowl winning teams. Parker coached the Steelers, Detroit Lions, and Chicago Cardinals from 1949-1964. His career record was 104-75-9.
Hines Ward: Hines has been knocking on the door for a few years now. Although he doesn’t have many individual accolades, he does have a huge list of intangibles as well as two Super Bowl rings and a Super Bowl MVP to his name.
James Harrison: The fan-favorite OLB was the 2008 NFL Defensive Player of the year. He is also a five-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro, and of course, has two Super Bowl Rings.
Mike Tomlin: Tomlin has built up a coaching resume that is as impressive as his predecessors Bill Cowher and Chuck Noll. Going into the 2024 season, he is now the longest tenured head coach in the NFL, and amazingly still doesn’t have a losing season. He is a Super Bowl champion and has a great overall record of 173-100-2. Although he is probably far from retirement, he already has a Hall of Fame coaching resume at the age of 52.
T.J. Watt: Watt is only 29, but you can't deny these stats: six-time Pro Bowler, three-time league leader in sacks and two-time league leader in tackles for loss and the Defensive Player of the Year in 2021. A few more seasons of this pedigree and Canton is going to be adding some more black and gold very soon.

Experience Steelers History

This 10,000-square-foot exhibit walks visitors through every decade of Steelers history with never-before-seen artifacts and interactive exhibits that let you become part of Steelers history.

Steelers Hall of Honor Museum
Or, tackle your way through Pittsburgh football history at the Senator John Heinz History Center's Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum! Relive iconic Pittsburgh moments such as the Immaculate Reception, try on a Super Bowl ring, learn more about Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel and take a picture with the Terrible Fan. Featuring more than 70 interactive exhibits, this is the ultimate museum for any sports lover.

Go Behind The Scenes
Experience Steelers football up-close during an Acrisure Stadium Tour. The tours take fans on-field, in the locker rooms, through the Great Hall, including the Hall of Honor, and more. Tickets are only $10 per person for the Stadium Highlight Tour, but true fans may want to splurge on the Game Day Tours for unprecedented access to Steelers Game Day!

Get Some Gear
Need some new Steelers gear? Take a trip to Pittsburgh's authentic Strip District neighborhood for any and everything Steelers. Yinzers in the Burgh is a notable Pittsburgh sports store, filled with everything from Steelers onesies to a huge variety of Terrible Towels, Steelers hats, cold weather gear, jerseys and so much more. You can also find street vendors that sell various low-cost black and gold apparel.

Looking for more general black-and-gold apparel? Check out these local shops:

Take the Burgh Bus
All the fun of making jokes about Cleveland, on wheels! Join comedian Matt Light on the Burgh Bus as you tailgate through distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods, wave your Terrible Towel, compete at Pittsburgh trivia and much more on this truly one-of-a-kind tour.


Ride The Incline and Walk Around The Point
Have a day or two to kill before the game? Come visit these spots. Both attractions are often featured during NFL broadcasts of home Steelers games. The Duquesne Incline specifically has a great view of Pittsburgh during the fall and winter months. The Point is a go-to walk to take in pretty much anything you can see downtown, and it's an easy walk from there, over the bridge and into our North Shore where the Steelers play!

Catch Other Pittsburgh Sports
Not only does Pittsburgh come to life on Steelers Sundays, but our passionate fan base also brings that same energy to other teams throughout the city. In September (and hopefully October) the Pittsburgh Pirates season overlaps with the Steelers, making it possible to see both teams in a weekend at two world-renowned stadiums.

The same is true across two rivers at Highmark Stadium to support the Pittsburgh Riverhounds pro soccer team! From mid-October on, the Pittsburgh Penguins NHL team also plays in our Uptown neighborhood at PPG Paints Arena. Or, check out the Pitt Panthers who also play at Acrisure in ACC action! Pro Tip: Look at all our sports team schedules before you visit to see who else might be able to see while you're in town!

Head Under our Friday Night Lights
If you live and breathe football, you're in luck. Pittsburgh and the surrounding region is a hotbed of high school football activity, with powerhouse teams, NFL Draft-caliber talent and rivalries that pack the stadium.

Find schedules of our games on local news sites or through the WPIAL to see our own Friday Night Lights.


Go On a Brew Tour
Beer and football have always went hand-in-hand, but if you're in town for a Steelers game you're also lucky enough to be in one of the top craft beer cities in the country. Follow the Pittsburgh Brewers Guild for pre-made trails that let you explore a unique neighborhood and sampling their best suds. I'd recommend starting with their North Shore Trail, which allows you to sip six of my favorite brews all throughout our stadium district where the Steelers play.


North Shore Trail courtesy of the Pittsburgh Breweries website
If you have time to venture outside of the city, book a tour at Pittsburgh Brewing Co., the home of I.C. Light and Iron City Beer, for a behind-the-scenes tour of this AI-enhanced, state-of-the-art brewery.

A beautiful sight as IC Light is canned, boxed and shipped right in front of you.
Eat Like a Local
Food is serious business in Pittsburgh. We love our regional delicacies from pierogis and french fry-filled sandwiches to gobs and chipped ham. As our city grew and populations shifted, you can now find international cuisine, fine dining and Pittsburgh staples all on the same street.

My favorite way to enjoy all of our local favorites combines both our dining scene and the Steelers. Follow our guide to the Strip District and walk around to our various markets and restaurants (and don't forget some local beer), then bring your bounty to the lots outside Acrisure Stadium for the ultimate tailgate.


Visit The Great One
While Pittsburgh is no stranger to hall of famers and all stars, we have an entire museum dedicated to Roberto Clemente, housed in a historic firehouse and full of memorabilia from The Great One himself. Make sure to add on the wine tasting at the Clemente Museum for the full experience and keep an eye out for celebrity gear not just from Clemente but other baseball and Pittsburgh sports legends as you explore.


Ok, we've went over the plays and you should have your itinerary in hand. Time to break this huddle. We'll see you out there exploring the city and inside Acrisure Stadium screaming for the black and gold alongside us. HERE WE GO

Steelers Nation, Here We Go!
Let's celebrate the Pittsburgh Steelers – here and around the world.

Bringing home win after win, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one the city’s greatest ambassadors. Join the excitement of Steelers Nation by visiting the Immaculate Reception Monument on the North Shore, explore the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center and order the almost-famous Primanti Bros. sandwich for an authentic taste of Pittsburgh as you watch.

Read on for recommendations on how you can celebrate your love for everything Steelers no matter when you visit!

Pittsburgh Steelers History & Landmarks
A trip to Pittsburgh to celebrate the Steelers isn't complete without stopping at historic landmarks for photo ops! Here are a few must-see stops we suggest adding to your itinerary:

﻿Steelers Hall of Honor Museum
Relive 90 years of Steelers history at this incredible interactive experience right at Acrisure Stadium. Opened in 2022, the Steelers Hall of Honor gives fans a one-of-a-kind look at the team.

Diehard fans, families and general visitors will all find something new from the 50+ Hall of Honor inductees to calling your own play in the announce booth and more high energy fun as they learn about the team, the players, the coaches and the moments that define them.

The Immaculate Reception
On Dec. 23, 1972, the Pittsburgh Steelers played their first playoff game in franchise history against the Oakland Raiders. Just as the clock ran out, fullback Franco Harris scooped up the ball and ran for a touchdown that will forever be known as the Immaculate Reception. You can visit the memorial of this historic play in the exact spot where it happened on the site of the old Three Rivers Stadium near Acrisure Stadium.

BONUS: If you’re flying into Pittsburgh International Airport, be sure to check out the Franco Harris Immaculate Reception statue for the perfect Pittsburgh photo op, now located in the Landside Terminal (no ticket needed).

Take a Photo with The Chief
True Steelers fans know that a trip to Pittsburgh wouldn’t be complete without stopping for a photo with Steelers founder, Art Rooney, Sr. The Chief watches over Acrisure Stadium as a bronze statue holding his trademark cigar and has plenty of room for photos!


﻿Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at Heinz History Center
Discover the history behind the Steelers dynasty at the Heinz History Center! Holding the title of Pennsylvania’s largest History Museum, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum is located on the Heinz History Center’s second and third floors, celebrating Western Pennsylvania’s unsurpassed sports legacy.

Lining Smallman Street and Penn Avenue is Pittsburgh’s historic Strip District. Stop by any weekend morning and find the streets lined with shops and vendors eager to help you don the black and gold.

Bonus: Stop in at the original Primanti Bros. and enjoy a Primanti’s sandwich. Piled high with meat, cheese, french fries and slaw, their “Almost Famous" sandwiches are a staple to Pittsburgh. And while there, snap a selfie with the mural wall and Steelers players from now and then.

A Tradition of Excellence
Steelers Trivia
Here are some of our favorite Steelers facts for your next trivia night:

Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognized symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Steelers Tip: The Towel is for waving or decorating, not for drying your hands or using for any other towel-like purpose, which is believed to bring back luck.
Sometime during the fourth quarter before a big play or series, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Heinz Field. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. The tradition dates back to a 2002 comeback win against the Cleveland Browns.
Make sure to visit the FedEx Great Hall inside Heinz Field; it's basically a shrine to the greatest moments in football history with Super Bowl trophies, jerseys, rings and more on display.
In Pittsburgh, Big Ben was our 2x Super Bowl-winning quarterback, not a clock.
Steelers aren't just inventive in their get-up, we also like to give incredible moments in football nicknames like The Immaculate Reception, The Steel Curtain, and, most recently in honor of six Super Bowl Championships, Sixburgh.
While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represent one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore, and steel scrape is illustrated with blue.
During games, you'll hear fans chanting "Here We Go, Steelers!" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. Here We Go, originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. Having sold more than 120,000 copies of the original, Here We Go is now regularly updated to mention current players' names and has become an anthem for the team during playoffs.
Whether you're visiting for a game or just happen to be around the city during football season, you're sure to enjoy the unique Steelers atmosphere. To get a full taste of the football culture here in the 'Burgh, I encourage you head to Acrisure Stadium for a game or at least visit Stage AE for a free tailgate open before, during, and after home games. Plus, you can sign up for Steelers Nation Unite to earn exclusive rewards near and far from Pittsburgh.
Here We Go Steelers!

Eating Your Way Through Pittsburgh Sports
​Experience Pittsburgh’s food scene through our local sports scene

Next time you visit one of our three major stadiums, you can taste some of the best of our regional food, as well as some wacky options that surprisingly work.

PNC Park
PNC Park, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, has a variety of tasty treats. Classic Pittsburgh food options at the park include the Primanti Bros. sandwich, stacked high with deli coleslaw and French fries.

Enjoy a bite of our Only in Pittsburgh offerings at Chicken on the Hill, which features a menu inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District. Order the pimento friend chicken sandwich and thank us later. Deli Dogs (inspired by Smallman Street Deli) offers upscale takes on the classic ballpark hot dog, with high-quality dogs and buns served Reuben, Chicago and chili style. And, ballpark nachos get kicked up a notch by Nachoritas with queso and crema for a satisfying addition.

And that's just the beginning! Read our full recap of what to eat section by section of the stadium for a full look at the flavors of PNC Park.

PPG Paints Arena
When the Pittsburgh Penguins hit the ice at the PPG Paints Arena, there’s no shortage of food for fans to enjoy. Check out the meatballs at Emporio: A Meatball Joint. One of Pittsburgh’s best sushi restaurants, Nakama, has two locations in the arena where fresh rolls and sashimi are made throughout the game.

Quench your thirst with a beer from Turnpike Tavern’s selection, but if you’re looking for something sweet, enjoy a milkshake from one of Pittsburgh’s more beloved burger restaurants, Burgatory.

Acrisure Stadium
How do you make the American classic, the corndog, any better? You incorporate Doritos and pretzels. An order of Doritos Corn Dog Pretzels at Acrisure Stadium, home to the Pittsburgh Steelers, includes two freshly battered corn dogs, coated with crushed Doritos and topped with nacho cheese and scallions, on a bed of Doritos.

If you’re craving pizza, check out Franco’s Pizzeria, which features three Steelers’ themed pies: The Immaculate Pie, Gina Margarita & PeppeRooney Pizza. If beer isn’t your preferred beverage, Acrisure Stadium features a diverse wine selection at the North Shore Winery stand.

Also worth checking out at Acrisure are the Potato Patch Fries just like Kennywood does 'em (Section 106), Pierogi House for a Pittsburgh staple (Section 119) and the spicy chicken & waffle sandwich (Club seats).

Pro Tip: Use the Steelers Official Mobile App to order your next beer or snack so you can skip the line, pick-up by scanning your bar code and be back in your seat before you can say Franco's Italian Army.

With six Super Bowl victories, the Pittsburgh Steelers are recognized as one of the storied franchises in the history of the National Football League.

To help honor the men who contributed to this success, the team announced it was creating a Hall of Honor in August 2017.

"The Hall of Honor will serve as a tribute to the many individuals who have contributed greatly throughout the history of our franchise," said Steelers President Art Rooney II. "This is probably long overdue, and we are excited to begin the process of recognizing these individuals and their accomplishments, both on and off the field, during an annual series of ceremonies."

Each year, the Steelers will induct former players, coaches, and contributors who were integral in sustaining the franchise's success. The standard by which the members of the Hall of Honor are selected are based on the following criteria:

​Former Players:
​Retired for at least three seasons
Must have played for the Steelers for a minimum of three seasons
Should possess noteworthy career highlights, records, and achievements
​Former Coaches and Contributors
​Significant contributions to the team and community
The Hall of Honor's Inaugural Class was announced on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017.

The formal induction ceremony took place during the team's annual Alumni Weekend celebration, which took place on Nov. 25-26, 2017

Each Hall of Honor inductee receives a solid steel football, which replicates the original given to Steelers' founder Art Rooney Sr. by the United States Steel Corporation and United Steel Workers in 1982 on the occasion of the team's 50th Season.

Each of the Hall of Honor members also are recognized with a plaque and a steel football in a special display located inside the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum located in Acrisure Stadium.

Below are current members of the Steelers Hall of Honor.

Steelers Legends Community
Steelers Legends Community

More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future.

The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend."

We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler.

Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.

Women of Steel is the Pittsburgh Steelers' platform celebrating the NFL's largest female fanbase. Through exclusive events, contests and content, our mission is to unite women from all walks of life who share a passion for the Black and Gold.
Whether you're a die-hard Steelers fan or just started rooting for us, Women of Steel offers a community where you can connect, engage, and learn alongside other women of Steelers Nation.

During the 2023 season, female Steelers fans far & wide got the chance to nominate themselves for our Women of Steel Nominations contest! Six incredible women who submitted their stories of bravery, community work, and success got the chance to be featured on our digital platforms. Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with us Julie Morey

Team Player

Julie was born an hour east of Pittsburgh and has bled black & gold since she was old enough to understand the game she loves. After being a team player in softball, basketball, soccer, volleyball, and track & field, Julie finally settled on her true love: football. Her flag football team travels to very competitive tournaments in cities all over the country, such as Richmond, Tampa, Miami, Atlanta, and San Diego. She's been recognized by her peers for both her offensive and defensive prowess, having earned numerous tournament MVPs in both categories. Carla De Simone-Powell

All-Star Mom

Carla is a remarkable individual known for her strength, selflessness, and unwavering dedication to her family and community. As a full-time working mother, she not only raised her two beautiful daughters but also pursued a Master of Science degree from Duquesne University. Carla actively participated in her daughters' extracurricular activities, taking on leadership roles in the elementary school PTO and later becoming the president of the high school musical committee. Her volunteerism extended to coaching girls basketball, supporting marching band boosters and fundraising for the introduction of girls lacrosse at Ambridge High School. Jessica Shackelford

Golden Heart

Jessica Shackelford and her sister-in-law, Stefanie Rowland, recently helped launch HopeFull Bag Co., a company with a heartwarming mission. Together, they authored a children's Christmas book titled "The Bag Called Hope," accompanied by a large canvas bag, "The Hope Bag." The concept encouraged parents to read the book with their children, then fill the bag with unwanted toys to be donated to local community shelters. Over the past six months, Jessica and co-founder Stefanie have dedicated themselves to ensuring a perfect holiday season for every child by partnering with the non-profit Second Chance Toys, with a portion of every purchase contributing to their noble cause. Bonnie Hewitt

Gamechanger

Bonnie is a true warrior, having triumphed over debilitating health challenges to emerge as an inspiring entrepreneur and mental health coach. Joining forces with partners Marshall Faulk and David Meltzer, she has not only secured 1st place and $50k in a TV business pitch competition, but has also become an extraordinary football mom and single mother. Bonnie's journey, marked by resilience, extends beyond personal success; she passionately contributes to the community by providing financial literacy to schools, teachers, and undeserved areas. Her commitment to serving others, particularly as a mental health anxiety coach, showcases her integrity and dedication. Bonnie's impact is far-reaching, extending into the financial service industry where she pioneers change, breaking traditional gender barriers. As a beacon of inspiration, Bonnie paves the way for other women in the field, playing a vital role in transforming a historically male-dominated profession. Starla Street

The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[6]

In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[7][8][9] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight.

The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[6] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[10] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II.

The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.[11] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field.

Rooney family era (1933–present)
The Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the New York Giants.[6] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[12] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[6][13] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[14]

During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the "Phil-Pitt Eagles" and were known as the "Steagles". This team went 5–4–1.[15] In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the "Carpets").[6] This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[16]

The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21–0.[17] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a "Playoff Bowl" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[18]

In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL–NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[19] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($23.5 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[20]

Chuck Noll years (1969–1991)

Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s.
The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season.[21] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers "Mean" Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972,[22] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Donnie Shell and Mike Webster.[23] The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.[24]

The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two.[25] They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (1971–1979) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.

The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record.[26] The 1981 season was no better, with an 8–8 showing.[27] The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. "Mean" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984's AFC Championship Game appearance.[28]

After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players' strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8–7, but missed the playoffs.[29] In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.[30]

Noll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209–156–1.[31]

Bill Cowher years (1992–2006)
In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton.[32]


Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009
Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the "Blitzburgh" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[33][34] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later.[35] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship.

Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.[36]

Mike Tomlin years (2007–present)

On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term "retire", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team.[37] A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[38] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach.[39] Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.[40] In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title.[41] The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season.[42] The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title.[43] With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship,[44][45] Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the Arizona Cardinals.[46] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first).[47] In their title defense, the Steelers went 9–7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season.[48] In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12–4 record and an AFC North title.[49] The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship.[50][51] Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31–25.[52]

In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12–4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round.[53] The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins.[54] Overall, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in 2012.[55] In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason.[56] In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.[57] They lost 30–17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[58] The Steelers finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season.[59] They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.[62] They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.[63][64][65] In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13–3 mark.[66] Their postseason was short lived with a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[67] Despite a 9–6–1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs.[68] The Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season.[69] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11–0 start.[70] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12–4.[71] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48–37.[72] The 2021 season saw the team go 9–7–1 and make the postseason.[73] The Steelers lost 42–21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round.[74] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season.[75]

Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162–94–2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013–17 seasons were noted for record performances from the "Killer B's". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell.[76] Occasionally, the "Killer B's" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.[77]

Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.[78] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9–8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.[79] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10–7 and third in the AFC North.[80] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31–17.[81] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles.[82] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos.[83][84]

Summary
Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444–282–2 (.635) and an overall record of 480–305–2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.[85]

Ownership

Art Rooney II, controlling owner of the Steelers
Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations.[86] Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers – Timothy and Patrick – wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York.[87] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate "NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests".[88]

Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time:

Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr., John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys.
The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards, including Cornell University, UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, the American Red Cross, Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.[89]

Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams:[93]

Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam purchased the Cleveland Browns in 2012.
Hedge fund manager David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018.
Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023. Investment partner David Blitzer was also a part of the Harris group.
Season-by-season records
Further information: List of Pittsburgh Steelers seasons
Through the end of the 2023 season, the Steelers have an all-time record of 707–606–22, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times.[94]

In the NFL's "modern era" (since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8).[95] The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger.[96][97] The Steelers are 36–26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger.[98]

Civil rights advocacy
The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam),[a] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an "equal opportunity" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).[99]

Division championships
The Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.

Logo and uniforms
Further information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers

A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger.
The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the "Steagles"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used "Vegas Gold", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers "gold" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag.

The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the "Steelmark", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word "Steelers" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, "Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world." Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word "Steel", the team was given permission to add "ers" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.

The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.

The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.

The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.

The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.

In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the "bumblebee jerseys" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102]

Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants.

In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103]

In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.

Rivals
The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[105][106][107]

Divisional rivals
Cleveland Browns
Main article: Browns–Steelers rivalry
The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1;[108] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.[109][110]

Baltimore Ravens
Main article: Ravens–Steelers rivalry
Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable match-ups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20–13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13–10. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27–10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24.[111] The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record.[112]

Cincinnati Bengals
Main article: Bengals–Steelers rivalry
The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL–NFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.[113] The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38–31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory.[114] The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35.[115] The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.[116]

Conference
New England Patriots
Main article: Patriots–Steelers rivalry
The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.

The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998–2007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16), and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[117] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.

In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2–1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2–0), and the Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots.[118] In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on Sunday Night Football.

Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27–24 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020.[119]

Denver Broncos
Main article: Broncos–Steelers rivalry
The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24–23.

In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24–21 win.[120] Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the "316 game". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs.[121] Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27–19.

Las Vegas Raiders
Main article: Raiders–Steelers rivalry
The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.[122] The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24–13) and 1975 (16–10) to reach the Super Bowl. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland's George Atkinson as part of the NFL's "criminal element" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.

While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21–18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38–35 at Heinz Field.

In their most recent matchups, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24–21 on December 9, 2018, in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.[123] The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September 19, 2021, 26–17, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13–10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett. A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17–15.[124]

Inter Conference
Dallas Cowboys
Main article: Cowboys–Steelers rivalry
The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys[125] started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35–28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21–17 and Super Bowl XIII 35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13–13, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27–24 margin in overtime and won 35–30 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16.[126] The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24–19 margin.

Philadelphia Eagles
Main article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry
The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3.[127]

Culture
Mascot

Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007
Prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.[128] As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.[128] Diane Roles of Middlesex Township, submitted the winning name which was "meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, "Mc" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam, her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage."[129] Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.[128] Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized S, and the L is drawn to look like a beam of steel.[128]

Fanbase
Main article: Steeler Nation
The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.[11][130] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities.[131] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[132]

The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but "Steeler bars" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams.

The Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as "arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team".[132] Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975,[132] the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son.[133] Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.5 million for the school.[133]

Fight songs
The Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of "Here We Go Steelers" and the "Steelers Polka" (the latter a parody of "Pennsylvania Polka") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song "Here We Go" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans.[134] Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song "Renegade" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa, "Black and Yellow", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience.[135]

Cheerleaders
Main article: Pittsburgh Steelerettes
The Steelers were the first NFL team to have a cheerleading squad, they were known as the Steelerettes. Their run only lasted from 1961 to 1969. To this day, they were the only cheerleaders the team had in their history.[136]

Basketball
During the offseason, the Steelers have long participated in charity basketball games throughout Western Pennsylvania and neighboring areas. The games usually feature six active players as well as their player-coach playing against a group of local civic leaders.[137] The players, whose participants aren't announced until the day of the game, sign free autographs for fans during halftime.[138]

In 2001, the Steelers moved into Heinz Field.[139] The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes.[140] For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside. The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium.[141]

Training camp

Steelers at training camp in Latrobe
The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe.[142] The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: "... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland. Classic, wonderful slice of American culture. If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see."[143]

The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside. Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team.[144]

In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season.[145]

Historical facilities
The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s.[146]

In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices.[147] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director)[148][149] and suburban Ligonier[150] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

All-time team
In 2007, in celebration of the franchise's 75th season, the team announced an updated All-Time team of the 33 best players who have ever played for the Steelers.[198] This team supplanted the previous All-Time team of 24 players named as part of the 50th anniversary commemoration in 1982.[199]

A "Legends team" consisting of the club's best pre-1970s players was released concurrently with the latest All-Time team.[200]

Coaches
Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers head coaches
The Steelers have had 16 coaches through their history.[215] They have cycled through the fewest head coaches in the modern NFL history.[216] Their first coach was Forrest Douds, who coached them to a 3–6–2 record in 1933. Chuck Noll had the longest term as head coach with the Steelers; he is one of only four coaches to coach a single NFL team for 23 years.[6] Hired prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers current coach is Mike Tomlin.[217]

Media

Map of radio affiliates.
Further information: Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network
As of 2006, the Steelers' flagship radio stations were WDVE 102.5 FM and WBGG 970 AM. Both stations are owned by iHeartMedia. Games are also available on 51 radio stations in Pennsylvania, Western Maryland, Ohio, and Northern West Virginia.[219] The announcer is Tunch Ilkin. Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope, the longtime color analyst and inventor of the "Terrible Towel", retired after the 2004 season, and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season.

Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV, channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV, channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today. Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Both Batch and Hoke replaced former Steelers lineman Edmund Nelson, who retired from broadcasting in 2015.[220]

Thursday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV, channel 53 (along with home games with NFC opponents and some flexed interconference games), while ESPN Monday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on WTAE-TV, channel 4. (WTAE-TV is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which owns a 20% stake in ESPN.) By virtue of being members of the AFC, most of the Steelers' games air on CBS and KDKA. NBC Sunday Night Football games are carried by WPXI, channel 11, in the market.

The Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities.

Figures with broadcasting résumés
Main article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting
The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope, who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons (1970–2004).[221]

Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers.

Newspaper
The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.[222] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.

Usage in popular culture
The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:

The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[223]
Black Sunday in 1977[224]
Heaven Can Wait in 1978[225]
Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980[226]
Fighting Back in 1980[227]
Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980[228]
...All the Marbles in 1981
Evening Shade (TV series) 1990–1994[229]
The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998[230]
The Longest Yard in 2005
The Chief a theater production.
Black and Yellow in 2010.[231]
The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field[232][233]
Mad Men's April 14, 2013, episode has Don Draper, Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20–28).
Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE.[234]
The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.[235]

In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain.[236] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'.

The Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research
The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1 million.[237] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions.[238]

In June 2017, the Steelers announced an inaugural charity walk to raise money for the foundation.[239]

                                       Frequently Asked Questions
                   HOW MANY SEATS MAY I PURCHASE WITH MY WAIT LIST OFFER?  You may purchase up to four (4) seats.  
WHAT GAMES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEASON TICKET PACKAGE PRICE?  All ten guaranteed home games are included in the season ticket package, from preseason through the final regular season home game.  
HOW MUCH DOES A SEAT LICENSE COST?  
Seat license fee prices start at $1,250 per seat and will vary depending on location. Seat license fees are a required purchase for all licensed seat locations within Acrisure Stadium.
500-level licensed seating:
$1,250 (rows EE-LL) Sections 504-517 and 528-541
$1,500 (rows R-DD) Sections 504-517 and 528-541
$2,500 (rows F-Q) Sections 504-517 and 528-541
$3,000 (rows A-E) Sections 504-508, 513-517, 528-532, and 537-541
$4,500 (rows A-E) Sections 509-512 and 533-536
Lower bowl seating:
$4,000 (sections 120-125, sections 145-152, and sections 220-225)
$5,000 (sections 101 row FF-MM, section 144 row KK-PP, sections 102-107, sections 114-119, sections 126-131, sections 138-143, and sections 217, 218, 227, and 228)
$12,000 (sections 108-113 and sections 132-137)
Club seating:
$5,000 (North Club sections) Sections NC001-NC013
$5,000 (sections 205-207, sections 214-216, sections 229-231, sections 238-240, and all PNC Champions Club sections C148-C150 and FC1-FC5)
$10,000 (sections 208-213 and sections 232-237)   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LICENSED AND AN UNLICENSED SEAT?  A seat license allows the account holder to resell or transfer seat license ownership of seats once he or she no longer wishes to purchase season tickets. For unlicensed seats, season tickets can remain in the account holder's name only. Once the account holder of unlicensed seats no longer wishes to or is no longer able to renew the seats, those seats are returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Unlicensed seat locations include sections 519-526, section 219, section 226, and sections 101 rows A-EE and 144 rows A-JJ.  
AM I REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A SEAT LICENSE?  If we have licensed seats available through our office, the seat license fees will be applied to those seat locations. The seat license is a required, one-time, nonrefundable fee, so once it is paid, you are only responsible for purchasing the season ticket package each year.  
IF I PURCHASE UNLICENSED SEATS, DO I HAVE TO COMPLETE THE SEAT SELECTION PROCESS EACH SEASON?  No, your unlicensed seats will remain in your name for each season as long as you choose to purchase them. Unlicensed seats do not have an associated seat license, so they also do not have a licensed seat owner. Therefore, your unlicensed seats are renewable to you each year.  
IF I PURCHASE AN UNLICENSED SEAT LOCATION, CAN I PURCHASE A LICENSE FOR THAT LOCATION IN THE FUTURE?  No, all unlicensed seat locations are and will remain permanently unlicensed.  
WILL I EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE MY SEAT LOCATION IN FUTURE SEASONS?  The Pittsburgh Steelers have a relocation request process for Season Ticket Holders who wish to relocate within Acrisure Stadium. Each Season Ticket Holder becomes eligible to request a relocation after completing one full season with the team. Requests should be submitted to the Steelers by email and can be made for unlicensed or licensed seat locations.  
IF I PURCHASE UNLICENSED SEATS, CAN I STILL POST INDIVIDUAL GAME TICKETS FOR SALE OR ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFER TICKETS TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER?  Yes, you are still able to post tickets for sale and transfer individual game tickets through your Account Manager, even if your seats are unlicensed.  
WOULD I HAVE ACCESS TO MY SEASON TICKET LOCATION FOR ANY POTENTIAL POSTSEASON GAMES?  Yes, as a season ticket holder, you would have first right of refusal to your seat location for potential postseason games. Each new Season Ticket Holder will receive postseason registration information in mid-August. Postseason games are not a required purchase, but we would love to have you join us at Acrisure Stadium for playoffs!  
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DECLINE TO PURCHASE SEASON TICKETS?  You will be able to receive two offers while on the Wait List. We cannot guarantee the offers will take place over two consecutive years, but we typically are able to send your second offer within back to back seasons. You would still hold your same position in line, so you do not have to worry about dropping to the bottom of the list. However, if you do decline your second offer, then you will have to re-sign up for the Wait List.  
CAN I STILL BE ON THE WAIT LIST IF I AM ALREADY A SEASON TICKET HOLDER?  No, once you are a season ticket holder, you will be removed from the Wait List and are no longer eligible to purchase tickets through a Wait List offer. This includes season ticket holders who sign up through the STR Marketplace.  
HOW DO I KNOW WHERE I AM ON THE WAIT LIST AND WHEN I WILL RECEIVE MY OFFER?  We send offers to members of the Wait List by sign-up date. Wait List members are not assigned a number in line. You will receive an offer in accordance with the date you officially became a member of the Wait List. Always keep your contact information up to date on your Wait List account to ensure that you will receive your emailed offer.  
HOW DO I UPDATE MY ADDRESS ON MY WAIT LIST RECORD?  To update your address, please email us at STH@Steelers.com with your current information.         
Too excited to wait? You can purchase a stadium seat license from a current season ticket holders on the Seat License Marketplace.                    Access Marketplace

                               With six Super Bowl victories, the Pittsburgh Steelers are recognized as one of the storied franchises in the history of the National Football League. 
To help honor the men who contributed to this success, the team announced it was creating a Hall of Honor in August 2017. 
"The Hall of Honor will serve as a tribute to the many individuals who have contributed greatly throughout the history of our franchise," said Steelers President Art Rooney II. "This is probably long overdue, and we are excited to begin the process of recognizing these individuals and their accomplishments, both on and off the field, during an annual series of ceremonies." 
Each year, the Steelers will induct former players, coaches, and contributors who were integral in sustaining the franchise's success. The standard by which the members of the Hall of Honor are selected are based on the following criteria:
   
âFormer Players:  âRetired for at least three seasons
Must have played for the Steelers for a minimum of three seasons
Should possess noteworthy career highlights, records, and achievements    
âFormer Coaches and Contributors  âSignificant contributions to the team and community    
The Hall of Honor's Inaugural Class was announced on Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017. 
The formal induction ceremony took place during the team's annual Alumni Weekend celebration, which took place on Nov. 25-26, 2017 
Each Hall of Honor inductee receives a solid steel football, which replicates the original given to Steelers' founder Art Rooney Sr. by the United States Steel Corporation and United Steel Workers in 1982 on the occasion of the team's 50th Season. 
Each of the Hall of Honor members also are recognized with a plaque and a steel football in a special displayÂ located inside the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum located in Acrisure Stadium.
   
Below are current members of the Steelers Hall of Honor.

The NFL works with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services.

8. Data Security and Data Integrity 
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
   
9. Data Transfers 
When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in Contact Us.

You may choose to receive promotional emails, text messages, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from the applicable Member Club or other members of the NFL Family by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial emails you receive.

You may also opt out of receiving push notifications by turning off push notifications through your device settings. 
If you have multiple accounts or relationships with different Member Clubs or other NFL entities, you may need to opt out separately for each account and relationship in relation to these choices. In addition, if you would like to opt out of receiving push notifications on all of your devices, you must turn off the feature on each device. 
Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law. Your opt-out requests will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages. 
Certain of our Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights. To learn more about Nielsen measurement and your choices, including how to opt out, please visit http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy. 
You may also have choices available to you to opt out of the collection of your geolocation information, whether collected through location services, Bluetooth, or microphone access technology. Where collected, this information may be used in accordance with local laws to serve and display advertising relevant to your location. To understand your choices and opt out if desired, please visit your device settings.
   
13. Data Subject Rights 
Certain states in the United States and other international jurisdictions grant certain rights with respect to personal information. Depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, you may be afforded the following rights:  Access to your personal information in a portable format, or other information about our data processing practices.
To delete the personal information the NFL has collected about you.
To correct inaccurate personal information we have collected about you.
To object to or request the restriction of processing of your personal information.
To withdraw your consent.  To exercise your access, deletion, and correction rights, please submit your request by visiting our Data Subject Request Portal. If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry here. 
You may also be afforded, depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, certain rights relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information.  Where applicable, you may exercise the right to limit certain uses and disclosures of your sensitive personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link at the footer of our sites or by clicking here.
Where applicable, you may also withdraw your consent with respect to your sensitive personal information by submitting an inquiry here. You may also withdraw your consent with respect to precise geolocation information using your device settings, as discussed above.  Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations. 
Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may also be afforded the right to opt out of the sale, sharing, or processing of your personal information for purposes of serving you advertisements based on your activity across other sites and services ("cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising"). You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies. You may also exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your non-cookie-based personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link in the footer of applicable sites. 
Global Privacy Control and "Do Not Track" Signals: Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your state law opt-out requests to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website here. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. 
Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. 
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. 
We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request here.
   
14. NFL Events 
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed. 
We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event:  To produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice, or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities; and
In the case of images or footage captured on CCTV cameras, to ensure the safety of the venues hosting NFL Events and of individuals attending NFL Events.  Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in Disclosure of Information. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL. 
Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes.

PROCEDURE FOR ALLEGING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT UNDER
DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
Steelers will respond to alleged copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). The Privacy Policies do not protect information that Steelers may provide to third parties at its discretion or as required by law through copies of notices referenced below. 
A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Third Party Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a written notification pursuant to DMCA by providing Steelers with the following: 
1) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 
2) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 
3) Identification of the Third Party Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to locate the material; 
4) Information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; 
5) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the Third Party Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 
6) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 
B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Third Party Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Third Party Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to Steelers at the address set forth below: 
1) Your physical or electronic signature; 
2) Identification of the Third Party Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Third Party Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; 
3) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Third Party Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Third Party Content; and 
4) Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Seattle, Washington, USA, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. 
5) If a counter-notice is received by Steelers, Steelers may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Steelers may replace the removed Third Party Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Third Party Content provider, member or user, the removed Third Party Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Steelers' sole discretion. 
6) You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 13, your DMCA notice may not be valid. 
7) Steelers will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail or facsimile at the following address: Pittsburgh Steelers LLC, 100 Art Rooney Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15212 Attention: Amy Regan 
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. Steelers may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Steelers may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA. 
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. 
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification. 
Without limiting Steelers' other rights, Steelers may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by Steelers. 
You should also be aware that we may forward the DMCA Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

Stillhouse Rocks 
Each month, the first 150 customers to spend at least $100 exclusively on Stillhouse branded spirits from Boyd & Blair, Hidden Still Spirits or Noire Distillery will receive a free limited-edition rocks glass while supplies last.
A new rocks glass will be available each month of the season (a total of 5), and each will feature an element that commemorates the 1974 World Championship win.
If you are not among the first 150 fans to spend $100 with Boyd & Blair, Hidden Still Spirits or Noire Distillery, you could still win signed Steelers merchandise all month long.
The Stillhouse Rocks program runs through the end of January.                    Learn More

OUR ROSTER       VODKA & RUM 
Few things can live up to the legacy of the 1974 World Championship Steelers or the best defensive line in the history of the game. But we can forever immortalize both with the introduction of Boyd & Blair Steel Curtain Vodka and Boyd & Blair Steel Curtain Rum. The distillery of our hometown hero Boyd & Blair is a mere seven miles north of Acrisure Stadium and is run by lifelong Steeler fans and native Pittsburghers, Barry and Jen Young (Duquesne and Pitt alums, respectively) using only the finest Pennsylvania potatoes and locally-sourced molasses. Both the vodka and rum are award winners many times over, but the Potato Vodka made history by being named #1 Vodka by the "Ultimate Spirits Challenge" three times, beating out every other vodka brand globally! Standing side-by-side, the limited edition pair form the Steelers' famous hypocycloid logo and each bottle comes individually numbered. Begin your collection and raise a glass to the legendary Steel Curtain.                    PURCHASE NOW!
                       BOURBON WHISKEY

Fifty years ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers won their first championship that began a dynasty in the league. The Steelers continue to strive for consistency and patience in creating a winning standard: a mantra that mirrors the same dedication as Hidden Still Spirits.

Steelers Nation in Ireland 
"We look forward to engaging Ireland with our fans across the island, those that are already members of Steelers Nation, twirling their Terrible Towels, or new fans that will learn about the Steelers through the events and initiatives we plan to bring." - Dan Rooney, Steelers Director of Business Development & Strategy          Daniel M. Rooney

                                  About the Steelers, Ireland & the NFL's 'Global Markets Program' 
What is the NFL’s ‘Global Markets Program’?  The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US.
NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market.  
Why did the Steelers apply for a ‘Global Markets Programs’ license in Ireland?  There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature.
When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward.  
What does this mean for Ireland?  The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences.
The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced.  
Will the Steelers play a game in Ireland?  We are at the beginning of our journey in Ireland as part of the NFL'sÂ 'Global Markets Program' and much more research and planning needs to be done in this area. However, as part ofÂ our long-term planning, we aspire to return to the island to play an NFL game.  
Will the Steelers bring players to Ireland?  The Steelers plan is to host events and activities in Ireland that will engage fans and current and former players are a part of that strategy.     Advertising

About the Museum
Located in Acrisure Stadium, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating Steelers football. The Hall of Honor Museum is home to over 50 inductees and over 10,000 square feet of Steelers history. The museum provides opportunities for fans to learn more about the franchise, view rare artifacts preserved by the team, and relive the biggest moments and people in Steelers history. A portion of the proceeds go to the Art Rooney Scholarship Fund.       Interactive Exhibits
The walk through each decade of the franchise is accompanied by interactive videos, music, and calls to learn more about each moment and player. The Broadcast Booth is sure to be a favorite as fans make their stamp on a historic Steelers play call.      Historic Archives
Collected from 90 years of Steelers football, fans can view each of the six championship rings, artifacts and game worn uniforms from some of the greatest plays in NFL history and more.      Hall of Honor
Perhaps the highlight of the tour is the Hall of Honor that houses the bronzed football of each of the Hall of Honor members, over 50 on display. Visitors also have the opportunity to learn about each member through touch screen kiosks that include bios, photos, and videos on the inductees.      New Additions
The museum will feature a new rotating exhibit highlighting the 50th anniversary of Super Bowl IX, where the team won their first world championship, and the 1974 NFL Draft that produced five future Hall of Famers. This interactive display includes a photo op with an oversized Super Bowl team photo, highlights, quotes, and stats about the '74 team and season, and to highlight the display - the Super Bowl IX Lombardi Trophy for fans' viewing pleasure.
Other additions include personalized interactive features for fans and a new 'Hope Harvey' display, paying homage to the team which was the beginnings of the modern-day Steelers. The team was founded by Art Rooney, and he was a players-coach.                    Hours of Operation

                    Stories Like Me 
Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO
Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel.
Stories Like Me is an indie bookstore for children through young adults, a community hub, and a safe space where all people can find themselves represented in books. To build their business, Helen and Imogen drew on their love of stories, along with their skills as project management professionals and musicians (musicians are very detail-oriented!). Before opening their brick-and-mortar store in Greenfield in November 2022, they did small pop-ups all throughout Pittsburgh to bring diverse stories into the community.
Helen, a native of England began her career in film and TV, after which she worked as a project manager, brings all her Jedi/Mary Poppins-type super powers to making sure all kids and families can see themselves in stories. Imogen, named after a character from Shakespeare, reads everything voraciously, writes, organizes, and loves trying out boutique gins!
They find their joy and passion through finding stories for all of our kids and families.        Fierce Knockouts 
Karin Christoff / Owner
Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan. She earned her bachelor's in information technology and MBA after she was honorably discharged from active duty.
Inspired by her personal experiences during the pandemic, Karin founded Fierce Knockouts to address a gap in workout apparel for women. She recognized that many women gain weight around their midsection, yet most clothes are designed for an ideal body shape. By creating beautiful, confidence-boosting workout clothes, Karin aims to make busy women feel amazing whether they're working out, running errands, or doing chores at home. Her mission is to empower and uplift women, one outfit at a time.        Mele's Gifts & Party Planning 
Jarmele E. Fairclaugh / Gift Creator & Owner
Founded in 2019 by Gift Creator and Owner Jarmele E. Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments.
Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of loveâgift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning.
Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's familyâher son Michael and husband Markâencouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born.
Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable.

Karen Perdomo / Owner
Karen Perdomo, a Colombian and New Jersey native, with a background in school business administration, opened The Colombian Spot, a family business, in the former Pittsburgh Public Market in October of 2015 introducing Arepas in the city of Pittsburgh for the first time. Starting as a small business with a limited space and a limited menu, it grew into a full service restaurant in the South Side neighborhood and ever since, this has been the Latin spot for many families in a time where Latin American restaurants were non-existent in the city . Later in 2022, a second location opened in the Oakland area near Pitt campus offering take out options for students and professionals.
While Empanadas and Arepas are the signature items on the menu, The Colombian Spot offers a diverse Latin American fusion menu, and catering services. Karen's leadership, strategy, organization, discipline, and vision for the business, has developed many growing opportunities, including catering services for corporate and professional baseball teams, as well as community affiliations with Latin organizations and other local neighborhood organizations.

Steelers Alumni Legends | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com     
Steelers Legends Community 
More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future.
The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend."
We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler.

Your interactions with those social networking services are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant service. 
You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Notice.
   
7. Links to Other Websites 
The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Notice does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.
   
8. Data Security and Data Integrity 
The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
   
9. Data Transfers 
When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in Contact Us.
   
10. Data Retention 
We will retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, any legal requirements to retain your personal information in light of compliance obligations, any relevant litigation or regulatory investigations and to enable the NFL to defend or bring potential legal claims, the sensitivity of the relevant information, and the duration of your use of the Services.
   
11. Children's Privacy 
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined by local law. If we learn that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete it or otherwise comply with applicable law.
   
12. Communications Preferences and Other Choices 
You may choose to receive promotional emails, text messages, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from the applicable Member Club or other members of the NFL Family by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial emails you receive. You may opt out of receiving marketing text messages from the applicable Member Club or other member of the NFL Family by replying "STOP." You may also opt out of receiving push notifications by turning off push notifications through your device settings. 
If you have multiple accounts or relationships with different Member Clubs or other NFL entities, you may need to opt out separately for each account and relationship in relation to these choices. In addition, if you would like to opt out of receiving push notifications on all of your devices, you must turn off the feature on each device. 
Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law. Your opt-out requests will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages. 
Certain of our Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights. To learn more about Nielsen measurement and your choices, including how to opt out, please visit http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy. 
You may also have choices available to you to opt out of the collection of your geolocation information, whether collected through location services, Bluetooth, or microphone access technology. Where collected, this information may be used in accordance with local laws to serve and display advertising relevant to your location. To understand your choices and opt out if desired, please visit your device settings.
   
13. Data Subject Rights 
Certain states in the United States and other international jurisdictions grant certain rights with respect to personal information. Depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, you may be afforded the following rights:  Access to your personal information in a portable format, or other information about our data processing practices.
To delete the personal information the NFL has collected about you.
To correct inaccurate personal information we have collected about you.
To object to or request the restriction of processing of your personal information.
To withdraw your consent.  To exercise your access, deletion, and correction rights, please submit your request by visiting our Data Subject Request Portal. If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry here. 
You may also be afforded, depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, certain rights relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information.  Where applicable, you may exercise the right to limit certain uses and disclosures of your sensitive personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link at the footer of our sites or by clicking here.
Where applicable, you may also withdraw your consent with respect to your sensitive personal information by submitting an inquiry here. You may also withdraw your consent with respect to precise geolocation information using your device settings, as discussed above.  Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations. 
Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may also be afforded the right to opt out of the sale, sharing, or processing of your personal information for purposes of serving you advertisements based on your activity across other sites and services ("cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising"). You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies. You may also exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your non-cookie-based personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link in the footer of applicable sites. 
Global Privacy Control and "Do Not Track" Signals: Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your state law opt-out requests to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website here. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. 
Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. 
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. 
We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request here.
   
14. NFL Events 
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed. 
We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event:  To produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice, or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities; and
In the case of images or footage captured on CCTV cameras, to ensure the safety of the venues hosting NFL Events and of individuals attending NFL Events.  Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in Disclosure of Information. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL. 
Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes.

If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.

Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process personal information for the specific purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, as described above. Where such concept is recognized, our legal basis to process personal information includes:  Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, we will need to collect, process, and share your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information when entering into such an agreement, objecting to this type of processing, and/or exercising your deletion rights may mean that products and/or services cannot be provided to you.
Legitimate interest: In certain circumstances we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own, but this is provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This is on the basis of our legitimate interest to:  - provide you with information and services as requested by you on a non-contractual basis;

- The processing of your personal information does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy and ultimately benefits you in optimizing our provision of services to you.  Consent: We may, on occasion and where permitted by law, process your personal information based on your consent.

You may opt out of receiving certain marketing messages by exercising the choices described in Communications and Geolocation Preferences.To the extent our processing is based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal information for processing, as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services and for you to use all the features of our website.

Steelers ARCO 
Additional Disclosures for Individuals in Mexico 
Updated: September 3, 2024 
This section should be read and understood in conjunction with the rest of the Privacy Notice. This supplementary section, together with the provisions stated in the Privacy Notice, applies to events held within Mexican territory, as well as activities such as contests, sweepstakes, skill-based games, and similar promotions conducted and executed on behalf of the Steelers. 
I. ARCO RIGHTS 
If you reside in Mexico, pursuant to the Mexican Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties ("ARCO Law"), you are entitled to exercise certain rights with respect to your personal information. The rights that any person may exercise, in relation to the processing of their personal data are: (1) right of access, which is your right to obtain your personal data from us, as well as the information regarding the collection and processing of your data; (2) right to rectification, which is your right to request that we rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data; (3) right to cancellation, which implies your right to ask us to delete your personal data when the processing of the data does not comply with the ARCO Law or is no longer necessary or relevant for the purpose for which it was collected; and (4) right of opposition, which is your right to oppose, for legitimate reasons, the processing of your personal data. Collectively, these are your ARCO rights. 
Subject to certain limitations, you or your legal representative may exercise any of your ARCO rights and revoke your consent for the processing of your personal information ("ARCO request"). You may use the League's Data Subject Request Portal to exercise rights (1) through (3) above (i.e., access, rectification, and cancellation) and the League's Your Privacy Choices portal to exercise right (4), the right of opposition. Click here to file an appeal or submit an inquiry. 
We are required to confirm your identity prior to responding to your ARCO request. Therefore, your ARCO request must include and attach the following: (i) your name, address, or email address to receive an answer, (ii) documents to confirm your identity or the identity of your legal representative (if applicable); (iii) an accurate description of the specific personal data in question; and (iv) any other information or document which may facilitate the identification of your personal data. If you wish to include more detail relating to your specific ARCO request, please click here to select the "Inquiry" option to describe your request (please be sure to include reference to the "Steelers" in the detailed summary textbox). 
If the information provided on the ARCO request application does not comply with any of these formal requirements, you will be informed within five (5) business days after receipt of your ARCO request of the missing information and will be asked to supplement your ARCO request. You will have ten (10) business days from the day you receive the Steelers' request for more information to respond to such a request. If you do not respond within ten (10) business days, your ARCO request will not be processed. 
If the application complies with all the formal requirements, the process will continue in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1) We will communicate the response of the request to you or your legal representative, within twenty (20) business days, counted as of the date of receipt of your ARCO request. 
(2) Your processed ARCO request will be implemented within fifteen (15) business days following the date on which the response is communicated. 
(3) If circumstances require it, we may extend the implementation period for another fifteen (15) days. 
(4) Your ARCO request may be denied for the following reasons: (a) when the data in question does not pertain to you or your legal representative is not identified as such; (b) when your personal data is not found in our database; (c) when the rights of a third party are impaired; (d) when there is a legal impediment or a decision from a competent authority that restricts the execution of your ARCO request; and (e) when the rectification, cancellation, or opposition has recently been previously made by us. 
Please bear in mind that the exercise of the right to opposition will not proceed in those cases in which the processing of information is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation imposed upon us. 
II. DATA TRANSFERS 
Information about personal data we transfer to third-party recipients is available under the "Use of Information" and/or "Disclosure of Information" sections. Personal information is transferred subject to your consent, except as otherwise permitted under Article 37 of the ARCO Law. We will request your explicit consent before sharing your personal information with business partners for their marketing or other commercial purposes. 
When we transfer your personal information to third parties, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in "Contact Us". 
III. MISCELLANEOUS 
The foregoing shall apply to any retention and processing of personal data carried out by the Steelers. The processing of personal data described herein shall apply in the same manner (but not limited to) as those individuals who provide their data through any Steelers social media platform, or any digital platform, as the case may be, whether for marketing or promotional activities, additional information requests regarding any event, or any other purposes.

PNC PARK FEATURESOverviewFactsFirstsarrow-expand-53303arrow-contract-53304The BallparkPNC Park, which opened in spring 2001, is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887.This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort.LocationPNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages.DesignThe facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh.PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line.PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond.The home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years.FeaturesAmong the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices.Playing FieldThe irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches.The Pirates and the ParkPerhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come.Inside PNC ParkBallpark InformationBallpark EnhancementsGameday GuidePNC Park ToursConcerts & EventsPlan Your Special EventPirates Clubhouse StoreFeatures, Facts & FirstsLet's Go Bucs, Let's Go Green.Experience History at PNC Park

"The improvements to our main concourse come after discussions with our fans. These upgrades to improve entry into the ballpark, flow of the concourse and speed of service are a result of that feedback."NEW SCOREBOARD The new scoreboard in left field is more than double the size of the previous display, without taking away from the unrivaled views of Downtown Pittsburgh's skyline. A modern 10-millimeter pixel spacing display, resulting in more than 4K pixels in width, will yield stunningly clear imagery to fans throughout the ballpark.2022 PNC PARK ENHANCEMENTSFAT HEAD'S BULLPEN BARReplacing the former gameday security building, the creation of this new gathering space above the center field bullpens includes two rows of drink rails, comfortable seating, televisions and more. Like all of the new spaces, the Fat Head's Bullpen Bar offers a great view of the action on the field, so fans won’t miss a minute of the game while enjoying a craft beer on the Riverwalk.KIDS PLAY AREASThe kids play area in right field has been refreshed and is now expanded to flow along the Riverwalk into the center field area. The expansion features life-sized bobbleheads, a Lucky Climber shaped like a pirate ship, as well as an accessible kid's play bridge inspired by the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge. The evolution of the play area allows families to enjoy the play elements while remaining connected to the action on the field.THE MILLER LITE LANDINGLocated just above the Center Field fenceline, The Miller Lite Landing offers a fantastic view of the action on the field, as well as the perfect view back to the Roberto Clemente Bridge and downtown cityscape. The new social gathering space features new drink rails, tables and high-top seating creating a relaxed environment for all fans.NEW FOOD CONCEPTSTogether with ARAMARK, the Pirates have partnered with local Pittsburgh chefs to create new food concepts and specialty offerings. The new concepts are featured throughout the Riverwalk and in the arcade under the left field bleachers. This includes Cannonball Burger, inspired by Station in Bloomfield, Chicken on the Hill, inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District, and Deli Dogs, inspired by Smallman Street Deli.THE PATIOLocated between the Upper and Lower Bleacher seating areas in left field, The Patio is a newly widened and leveled area that extends from the bullpens to the Left Field Rotunda. The expansion of this platform and new furniture allows for a comfortable gathering space overlooking left field.AHN PICNIC PARKAlways a fantastic place to host groups, The Picnic Park will now feature upgraded furnishings, enhanced lighting and landscaping, as well as additional access points for greater connection to the new fan enhancements along the Riverwalk.LEFT FIELD LOUNGEThe Left Field Lounge exterior is now modified to create one large open platform with a new picket style drink rail that runs the length of the space. These enhancements improve the fan experience by allowing groups to comfortably move about the space, all while allowing for improved sight lines from within the Left Field Lounge.CINDERLANDS CORNER BAROpen to all fans, The Cinderlands Corner Bar is a gathering space below the Left Field Rotunda featuring specialty drinks, local craft beers as well as fan favorite traditional Pittsburgh brews. The area connects the fans in the Cinderlands Corner Bar to the action on the field. The open feel and additional TVs and furniture provide a more fan friendly environment.CELEBRATING HISTORYRetired numbers inspired by the steel design of the nearby three sister bridges and oversized baseballs, celebrating Pittsburgh's rich baseball history, are meticulously positioned throughout the landscaping of the Lower Riverwalk for visitors to enjoy year around.

LET'S GO BUCS. LET'S GO GREEN.DUQUESNE LIGHT POWER HITTERS PROGRAMThe Pirates and Duquesne Light teamed up for a unique Power Hitters Program that resulted in 282 trees being planted in Pittsburgh over the course of the 2021 and 2022 season. These trees were planted in underserved communities and targeted historically marginalized neighborhoods because research shows these neighborhoods are more susceptible to "heat island impacts," which can cause impaired water quality, increased energy consumption, and compromised health quality. The neighborhoods are urban areas with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure that absorb the suns heat more than naturally landscaped areas. This causes the neighborhoods to become "islands" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas.PNC PARK URBAN GARDENPittsburgh Pirates continue to maintain the PNC Park Urban Garden. The Urban Garden uses sustainable practices and provides vegetables and herbs, grown on-site, to be used in Pirates players' favorite healthy dishes prepared by the Pirates Executive Chef Tony Palatucci.Learn More RECYCLINGJust like families at home, our Pirates family works hard each season to reduce, reuse and recycle, not just on Earth Day, but every day. In over a decade of sustainability efforts at PNC Park, the Pirates and our partners have recycled...Cardboard1,825 TonsThat’s the equivalent weight of over 200 T-Rex dinos!Fryer Oil219 TonsThis oil is recycled and eventually used as biofuel.Other Recyclables2,492 TonsIncluding electronics, toner cartridges, metal, batteries, and more.Plastic793 TonsIncluding 1.3 million plastic bottles used by fans each season.Mixed Paper206 TonsPlus, all paper in the front office is at least 30% post-consumer material.Aluminum521 TonsSince we have started recycling, we have recycled 521 tons of aluminum.COMPOSTINGFood9,171 TonsYard Waste2,037 TonsWhat is composting, anyway?Composting is organic recycling. Composting allows for the controlled collection of food & organic material, rather than waste-producing methane gas during decomposition in landfills. Direct benefits to soil include increased aeration and structural stability, improved activity of beneficial micro-organisms, faster root development, and ultimately higher yields of agricultural crops.Consider this: If just 25 Pirates fans diverted their food waste to composting for one year, it would equal eliminating the emissions from a 6,000-mile train trip!FOOD DONATIONSOver 29,450 pounds of food was donated between Pirates Executive Chef Tony and Aramark to 412 Food Rescue in 2023.The Pirates sustainability practices successfully divert more than 70-percent of the ballpark waste out of the waste stream each year, equivalent to more than 1,650 tons of materials.
Averaged a 70% diversion rate since the inception of the Pirates sustainability efforts.
71% Diversion rate in 2023
Diverted over 1664 tons of materials from landfills in 2023.

It is not possible for a map like this to show the precise location of the netting and/or to what extent the netting may or may not impact your view. In addition, even if netting exists in a particular location, it is still possible for balls, bats and other objects to leave the field of play and enter the stands. No seat at PNC Park is free from the risk of injury inherent in attending a live baseball game. Each ticket holder assumes all risk of injury.For more information on netting locations and seating options, please call the Pirates Ticket Office at 1-800-BUY-BUCS (1-800-289-2827).

This initiative is a collaborative effort with key partners with the goal of reducing negative impact on the environment and promoting sustainable practices to help preserve natural resources, while also supporting economic and social development.            PPG Sets 2030 Sustainability Goals, Including Science-Based Emissions Reduction TargetsPPG is committed to using resources efficiently, developing industry-leading sustainably advantaged solutions, and prioritizing decarbonization to protect the world for current and future generations.
In 2023, PPG became the first U.S.-based coatings manufacturer to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for 2030 scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets. As part of these targets, the company also introduced further 2030 sustainability goals that focus on driving sales of sustainably advantaged products, reducing its environmental impact, and making a difference in communities.
PPGâs paints, coatings and specialty materials protect and beautify the world, many of which offer benefits that support its customers' sustainability ambitions. In 2023, 44% of PPG sales were from sustainably advantaged products and processes that address multiple sustainability benefits, including lower emissions, lower toxicity, energy efficiency, use of renewable raw materials or extending durability.
PPGâs Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report details advancements in its sustainably advantaged innovations, governance of ESG, efforts to reach its 2030 targets and further actions to support customers' sustainability goals. The report is available atÂ ppg.com/sustainability.   Score for the TreesThe Pittsburgh Penguins and The Davey Tree Expert Company have partnered to plant trees in the greater Pittsburgh area! Every goal scored by a Penguin on home ice adds a number to the tree counter. The two organizations will work with Tree Pittsburgh to plant the total number of trees in or around the city to help restore the urban forest in Pittsburgh.
We have planted 273 trees thanks to all of the Penguins home goals scored in the 2022.23 and 2023.24 seasons!
"This partnership with the Penguins is exciting because it's making Pittsburgh a greener space for the residents, businesses, and overall community, which is proven to have tremendous health and economic benefits," said Sandra Reid, vice president of corporate communications and strategic planning at Davey Tree. "Cities across the country need to expand and reestablish their urban forests, so it's great to be included in Pittsburgh's mission to do so, and Davey is thrilled to be a part of the process."

Household Hazardous Waste Chemical CollectionFor the past 3 years, PPG has partnered with the Pennsylvania Resource Council (PRC) to host the annual Household Hazardous Waste Chemical collection. This is a drive-through event at PPG Paints Arena which has provided over 1,000 Penguins fans and community members with an opportunity to safely discard any household chemicals such as paints, cleaners, and pesticides throughout the years. Together, PPG, the Penguins, and PRC have been able to help safely dispose of 135,000 pounds of chemical waste, keeping the materials out of homes and garages, while diverting them from our soil, air, and water.   Making a Home for Bald EaglesFor the past few years, a pair of bald eagles, named "Irvin" and "Claire" (after U.S. Steel's Clairton plant) have been thriving on property at U. S. Steel's Mon Valley Works Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, PA. U. S. Steel shares the beauty of these majestic birds with the community through the installation of live cameras. This is believed to be the first such camera at a steel plant and only the third camera of its kind in Pennsylvania.

Penguins, PPG Paints Arena Partner with Green Sports AllianceThe Pittsburgh Penguins and PPG Paints Arena are members of the Green Sports Alliance, an environmentally and socially responsible focused nonprofit organization that convenes stakeholders from around the sporting world.
The Pittsburgh Penguins will collaborate with other Green Sports Alliance members which include professional sports leagues, teams, venues, universities, and corporate partners to support, expand, and promote their sustainability practices. VisitÂ greensportsalliance.orgÂ for more information.   Powering Our Past and Pioneering Our FutureHave you ever thought about how steel shapes our world? It's not just about towering skyscrapers or massive bridges. Steel has been the backbone of our past and itâs essential to a sustainable future. At U. S. Steel, we are building the future of steel and we're building it one innovation at a time.
We recently turned two diesel locomotives at our Mon Valley Works into eco-friendly, battery-powered machines. The locomotives, which travel within the facilities carrying steel, coke, scrap metal, iron ore, and other materials necessary for production, are expected to reduce airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by .385 tons - the equivalent emissions of 7,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.
As we march towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, every step counts. Environmental stewardship isn't just a fancy term for us. It's at the core of everything we do, embedded deep in our S.T.E.E.L. Principles. We're talking about a serious commitment to safeguarding our natural resources. After all, our communities, our ecosystems, and heck, our entire planet's future depends on it.   Indra Energy Penguins Pledge Partner and Champion Sustainability PartnerIndra Energy is committed to promoting earth-friendly energy and green causes. Our renewable energy plans empower customers to make an impact on their communities. Our customers' electricity usage is paired with renewable energy certificates generated from alternative energy sources in the United States, which may include wind, solar, hydro, or any other zero-emission sources that have been qualified as such. Our residential natural gas usage will be paired with carbon offsets. In 2022 alone, our customers prevented an Estimated 167k+ tons* of carbon from entering the atmosphere just by using our renewable energy plans (*Calculated using the EPAâs Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator).
Going beyond energy to make a difference is Indra Energyâs commitment. We are proud partners of the Penguins Pledge, and we are actively supporting four forest planting projects across the United States: replanting in the Rockies and our National Forests, along with replanting on the Appalachian Trail and restoring forests destroyed by fire.

Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists - National Aviary and EQT PartnershipThanks to a generous grant from EQT Corporation and the EQT Foundation, National Aviary educators and their flock of Ambassador Birds went on the road during the 2023.24 school year, bringing the Aviary to rural Pennsylvania classrooms. The Aviary presented conservation messaging through 10 in-class and assembly programs to schools outside of Allegheny County.
The National Aviary and EQTâs outreach program, Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists, was a tremendous success, teaching concepts in science, technology, engineering, environmental literacy, and sustainability (STEELS), as well as math, geography, wildlife conservation, and more, free of charge to schools.
âThe live owl is the best! We learned about owls, predator/prey, nocturnal animals, in Kindergarten! They were so excited afterwards, that's all they talked about. It was excellent! I hope this continues every year!ââKindergarten teacher from Kiski Area School District
In 2023.24, because of the EQT Foundationâs support, the National Aviary met with approximately 2,840 rural students and 133 educatorsâa 28 percent increase in the number of students from 2022-2023!
Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists significantly impacts students by providing an engaging, fun science program to thousands of children who are able to apply new information about birds, their native habitats, the environmental pressures they face, and the role that humans play in creating or mitigating these challenges, inspiring conservation action. This is a true partnership between EQT, the Aviary, and teachers and school districts in rural counties.
Through the ongoing partnership with EQT and the EQT Foundation, the National Aviary will continue to work with rural schools in the 2024.25 school year.

Security
We maintain appropriate and reasonable organizational and technical measures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion.

For the health and safety of our fans, staff, and players, it is important we all do our part. Please do not attend if you are feeling ill.
Be sure to download the Penguins App to access your mobile tickets.           1. Mobile TicketingPPG Paints Arena is a mobile-only facility. For game entry, a mobile ticket must be displayed on a smartphone. Ticket buyers and fans that received forwarded tickets can access their tickets by visitingÂ www.pittsburghpenguins.com/myaccountÂ or the Penguins app. If tickets were purchased throughÂ ticketmaster.com, we encourage you to download the Ticketmaster app.Â 
All mobile tickets will feature a rotating barcode. As a result,Â camera screenshots or paper printouts will not work. If you place your digital ticket in your Apple wallet, no barcode will be visible - however, the scanners will detect it! If you do not have a mobile ticket for entry, you will be directed to the DICK'S Sporting Goods Box Office inside the Highmark Gate for assistance.
