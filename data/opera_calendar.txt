She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza.Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed.PAGLIACCIPROLOGUETonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people.ACT IThe same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking.ACT IIThat evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.Courtesy of the Metropolitan OperaDETAILS & RESOURCESWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!Here are some details and resources to help. Also visit ourOpera FAQsor ourAccessibility page.Run time: 2 hrs 50 min (includes one 30-minute intermission)Understand Every Word: Understand Every Word: Both operas are sung in Italian, but English supertitles are projected above the stageParking Downtown:get real-time parking availabilityPre-Opera Talksbefore each performanceBraille Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterLarge-Print Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterDownload the Study Guide forCavalleria RusticanaDownload the Study Guide forPagliacciCHILD POLICY:Children must be ages 6 and up.

TOSCAMusic by Giacomo PucciniLibretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa • OCTOBER 5, 8, 11, 13, 2024BUY TICKETSShe lived for art. Would she die for love?When painter Cavaradossi—the lover of Rome’s enchanting diva Floria Tosca—decides to harbor a fugitive of the law, he makes himself and his beloved Tosca a target of the corrupt Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all.Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours. See why Tosca is one of the most powerful operas ever written.These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)(photo credit: David Bachman)PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATIONWhere:Benedum Center, at the corner of 7th Street and Penn Ave, downtown PittsburghWhen:Saturday, October 5, 2024  * 8:00 PM - ~10:35 PM (approx. end time)Tuesday, October 8, 2024  * 7:00 PM- ~9:35 PM (approx. end time)Friday, October 11, 2024  * 7:30 PM- ~10:05 PM (approx. end time)Sunday, October 13, 2024  * 2:00 PM- ~4:35 PM (approx. end time)CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAMFloria Tosca:Ana María Martínez+Mario Cavaradossi:Jonathan BurtonBaron Scarpia:Kyle AlbertsonCesare Angelotti:Erik Nordstrom*+Spoletta:Fran Daniel Laucerica*Sacristan:Brian KontesSciarrone:Matthew Soibelman*+Shepherd boy:Shannon Crowley*+Jailer: J.

As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”).ACT II.In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand.ACT III.The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death.-Adapted from Opera NewsDETAILS AND RESOURCESWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!Here are some details and resources to help. Also visit ourOpera FAQsor ourAccessibility page.Run time: approx. 2 hours 36 minutes (includes two intermissions)Act I46 minutesIntermission20 minutesAct II42 minutesIntermission20 minutesAct III28 minutesTOTAL2 hours, 36 minutesUnderstand Every Word: Understand Every Word:Toscais sung in Italian, but English supertitles are projected above the stageSpecial Effects Notice:Simulated gunshots are used in this productionParking Downtown:get real-time parking availabilityPre-Opera Talksbefore each performanceBraille Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterLarge-Print Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterDownload theStudy Guidehere.CHILD POLICY:Children must be ages 6 and up.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife.Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet.Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again.Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die.A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night.Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him.Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.Courtesy of Cincinnati OperaDETAILS & RESOURCESWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!Here are some details and resources to help. Also visit ourOpera FAQsor ourAccessibility page.Run time: approx. 3 hrs (includes one 30-minute intermission)Understand Every Word: Understand Every Word:Madama Butterflyis sung in Italian, but English supertitles are projected above the stageParking Downtown:get real-time parking availabilityPre-Opera Talksbefore each performanceBraille Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterLarge-Print Programsavailable at The Benedum CenterCHILD POLICY:Children must be ages 6 and up.

WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSEDMusic by Jennifer HigdonLibretto by Jerre Dye • APRIL 26, 29, MAY 2, 4, 2025BUY TICKETSA family portraitWhen Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composerJennifer Higdon(Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned byOpera Philadelphia.Funded in part by The Amphion Foundation, Inc.PERFORMANCE DATES/TIMES/LOCATIONWhere: The Bitz Opera Factory (Pittsburgh Opera's headquarters), 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh's Strip DistrictWhen:Saturday, April 26, 2025  * 8:00 PM- ~9:15 PM (approx. end time)Tuesday, April 29, 2025  * 7:00 PM- ~8:15 PM (approx. end time)Friday, May 2, 2025 * 7:30 PM- ~8:45 PM (approx. end time)Sunday, May 4, 2025 * 4:00 PM- ~5:15 PM (approx. end time)CAST AND ARTISTIC TEAMMona:Meredith Arwady+Curator:Audrey Welsh*Thomas:Fran Daniel Laucerica*Momma:Lauryn Davis*Inspector:Matthew Soibelman*Conductor:Antony Walker(April 26, 29, May 2, 2025)Conductor:Glenn Lewis(May 4, 2025)Stage Director:Kristine McIntyreSet Designer: Luke CantarellaCostume Designer: Nancy JulianWig and Make-up Designer: TBALighting Designer: Todd NonnStage Manager: Tess NavalDirector of Musical Studies:Mark TrawkaAssociate Coach/Pianist:James LesniakResident Artist Pianist / Supertitle Caller:  Maeve Berry*Assistant Stage Director: Dana Kinney*+    Pittsburgh Opera debut*    Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist**   Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist alumniSYNOPSISSeven priceless paintings have been stolen from the walls of a museum in the dead of the night. The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona.In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life.The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly.Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future.With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings whilesimultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother?

She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him.Act 1Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. The heathen sorceress Armida seems to have triumphed over the crusaders, but fears that her conquest is not complete without gaining the love of the Christian knight Rinaldo. Now Rinaldo is obsessed with Armida and promises to fight against his fellow Christians, if victorious King Idreno offers him the kingdom and Armida’s hand. Armida prays for Rinaldo’s safety.Scene 2: A steep mountain, with Armida's fortress at the top. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarco plan to free Rinaldo from Armida’s clutches. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians but on encountering Clotarco she falls in love with him and offers to lead him to safety.Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of the approaching knights. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo to beware Armida's charms, and reproaches the dereliction of his duty as a Christian. Although remorseful, Rinaldo is unable to escape Armida's enchantment.Act 2Scene 1: A garden in Armida's palace. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarco's demand that the Christian knights enchanted by Armida be freed. Reluctantly, Rinaldo leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury.Scene 2: The crusader camp. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo, who prepares to go into battle. Armida begs for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo departs for battle with Ubaldo and the other soldiers.Act 3Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, knowing that the tree holds the secret of Armida’s powers, enters the wood intending to cut it down. Zelmira appears with a group of nymphs, and they try to get him to return to Armida. As he is about to strike the myrtle, Armida, dishevelled, appears from it and confronts him. Armida cannot bring herself to kill him; Rinaldo strikes the tree and the magic wood vanishes.Scene 2: The crusader camp. The crusaders prepare for battle against the Saracens. Armida appears, swearing to pursue Rinaldo everywhere. As Rinaldo moves off, she sends an infernal chariot after Rinaldo.Courtesy of Pinchgut OperaDETAILS & RESOURCESWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!Here are some details and resources to help. Also visit ourOpera FAQsor ourAccessibility page.Run time: TBAUnderstand Every Word: Understand Every Word:Armidais sung in Italian, but English supertitles are projected above the stagePre-Opera Talksbefore each performanceBraille ProgramsavailableLarge-Print ProgramsavailableCHILD POLICY:Children must be ages 6 and up.
