    BUY TICKETS
       
A family portraitWhen Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia. Funded in part by The Amphion Foundation, Inc.

				SYNOPSIS
				      Seven priceless paintings have been stolen from the walls of a museum in the dead of the night. The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona.
In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life.
The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly.
Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future.
With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings whilesimultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go.

Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by: Creating live opera at the highest standards of artistic excellence
Making opera accessible to a diverse audience
Developing young singers into tomorrow’s artists
Ensuring the future through responsible fiscal management The current leader of Pittsburgh Opera is Christopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to Bitz Opera Factory in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there.
Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note.
Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. 
Our Beginnings
Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianist Virginia C. Byerly; contralto Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey; Priscilla W. Collins; Ruby N. Wickersham; and Marie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States.
The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was The Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor, Richard Karp of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971.
In 1983, Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera.
Mark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company’s assets threefold and cemented the Opera’s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region.
Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and John Mauceri as Music Director in 2001.
Our New Home
In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company’s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011.
In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its educational events annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Program is among the country’s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free community Song Shop Concerts to concert recitals by world-class opera singers.
Pittsburgh Opera’s long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come.

Dec            Your opera journey begins today!
Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like...        
				MYTH: I'LL HAVE TO WEAR A TUXEDO OR A FANCY BALL GOWN
				      Come as you are or glam it up!
On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable!   Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)    
				MYTH: BUT IT'S SOOOOO EXPENSIVE! 
				      Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn!
There are even discounts for groups of 6+, students, 20-Something Tuesdays and more.     
				MYTH: I WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
				       English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word!     
				MYTH: OPERA IS BORING!
				      Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings?
Operas have these in spades! That's why the term "operatic" has come to mean "dramatic to the nth degree."     
These two will slice your notions of "boring" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)    
				MYTH: OPERAS ARE TOO LONG
				      Operas come in all shapes and sizes!
The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way.     
				MYTH: ALL OPERA SOUNDS THE SAME
				      Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too!
While almost all operas make use of "classical voice technique," which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop!     We Shall Not Be Moved lays down fresh beats (Video credit: RLG Creations)     Some playful 18th century coluratura from Semele (Video credit: RLG Creations)     Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations)     A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations)    
				MYTH: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PhD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
				      You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie!
Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to the Pre Opera Talk, Meet The Artists, or pick up a Study Guide at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening!    
				MYTH: OPERAS ARE ALWAYS DEPRESSING
				      Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too.
While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones!   Who doesn't love a happy ending? (Photo credit: David Bachman)

Dec        Pittsburgh Opera offers a range of services to help ensure all adults enjoy their opera experience.
 
Audio Commentary Service
Pittsburgh Opera offers an Audio Commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the Tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified).
Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling 412-281-0912, extension 213.
An all-volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. An audio describer reads from the program book ten minutes before the performance—the "pre-show"—and then reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage during the performance—the "play-by-play". We're thankful to our volunteers who provide this service each season!             
Pittsburgh Opera Audio Commentary Team— Julia, Ray, Jan, Donna, and Mary Ann
Braille and Large-Print Programs
Braille and large-print programs are available at each performance. 
Hearing Assistance
Infrared hearing devices are available at our Benedum Center performances. Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is for audio amplification.
Sign Language Interpretation 
Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Please see our accessibility webpage for details.
Opera Study Guides
The Study Guides for each opera are posted in PDF format on the Pittsburgh Opera website in advance of the opera's opening, and are available in paper form at all performances, in the lobby area. 
For more information about Pittsburgh Opera programs for Adults, please email Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, or call her at 412-281-0912, ext. 242.

Dec        Pittsburgh Opera is debuting an innovative rideshare voucher program to make it easier for patrons to get to and from their opera performances.
The program is generously funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation.
The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. All performances of Pittsburgh Opera’s remaining 2024 operas in downtown Pittsburgh are eligible: Tosca - October 5, 8, 11, 13
Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci double feature - November 9, 12, 15, 17 A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last.
Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater.      
				HOW TO ADD A RIDESHARE VOUCHER TO YOUR TICKET PURCHASE:
				      1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box:
(See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:)   2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page:   3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for:   4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu:   You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance.   You can then check Check Out as usual.    
				HOW DOES IT WORK?
				      Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records.
At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this:    
Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method.
Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them.   Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you.      				FAQS
				      When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can.
Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine.  
What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages.
What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free.
Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use.
I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage, or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. 
Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber.
Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food.
I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases.
What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient.  I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal?
As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher.
     
				TERMS AND CONDITIONS
				      Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc.
A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last.
Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases.

    BUY TICKETS
       
All’s fair in love and warTo prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, The Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. But, to her surprise, she becomes enchanted by him as well. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him. For both, duty clashes with desire. As war rages around them, will love conquer them both?Containing some of Haydn’s most inspired music, not only is Armida Haydn’s most highly regarded opera, but the composer himself referred to it as his best work.
These will be Pittsburgh Opera's first performances of Armida. Pittsburgh Opera will mount a new production.

				SYNOPSIS
				      To prevent the capture of Jerusalem by the knights of the First Crusade, The Prince of Darkness has sent the enchantress Armida into the world to seduce the Christian heroes and turn them from their duty. The bravest of these, Rinaldo, has fallen under Armida's spell. She comes to love him so deeply that she cannot bring herself to destroy him.
Act 1Scene 1: A council chamber in the royal palace of Damascus. King Idreno is alarmed that the crusaders have crossed the Jordan River. The heathen sorceress Armida seems to have triumphed over the crusaders, but fears that her conquest is not complete without gaining the love of the Christian knight Rinaldo. Now Rinaldo is obsessed with Armida and promises to fight against his fellow Christians, if victorious King Idreno offers him the kingdom and Armida’s hand. Armida prays for Rinaldo’s safety.
Scene 2: A steep mountain, with Armida's fortress at the top. The knights Ubaldo and Clotarco plan to free Rinaldo from Armida’s clutches. Idreno sends Zelmira, the daughter of the sultan of Egypt, to ensnare the Christians but on encountering Clotarco she falls in love with him and offers to lead him to safety.
Scene 3: Armida's apartments. Rinaldo admires the bravery of the approaching knights. Ubaldo warns Rinaldo to beware Armida's charms, and reproaches the dereliction of his duty as a Christian. Although remorseful, Rinaldo is unable to escape Armida's enchantment.
Act 2Scene 1: A garden in Armida's palace. Zelmira fails to dissuade Idreno from planning an ambush of the crusaders. Idreno pretends to agree to Clotarco's demand that the Christian knights enchanted by Armida be freed. Reluctantly, Rinaldo leaves with Ubaldo. Armida expresses her fury.
Scene 2: The crusader camp. Ubaldo welcomes Rinaldo, who prepares to go into battle. Armida begs for refuge and Rinaldo’s love. Rinaldo departs for battle with Ubaldo and the other soldiers.
Act 3Scene 1: A dark, forbidding grove, with a large myrtle tree. Rinaldo, knowing that the tree holds the secret of Armida’s powers, enters the wood intending to cut it down. Zelmira appears with a group of nymphs, and they try to get him to return to Armida. As he is about to strike the myrtle, Armida, dishevelled, appears from it and confronts him. Armida cannot bring herself to kill him; Rinaldo strikes the tree and the magic wood vanishes.
Scene 2: The crusader camp. The crusaders prepare for battle against the Saracens. Armida appears, swearing to pursue Rinaldo everywhere. As Rinaldo moves off, she sends an infernal chariot after Rinaldo.

Dec        Double or Triple Your Impact!
Many employers have matching gift programs to match charitable contributions made by their employees. Gifts from retirees may also qualify for a match. Participating in your company’s matching gift program is a great way for you to enable your employer to join with you in supporting your philanthropy to Pittsburgh Opera.
If you are a Pittsburgh Opera volunteer, your company may also have a Volunteer Grant Program.
Please contact Torey Gricks for more information about Pittsburgh Opera and increasing your support through leveraging your corporate match, or check out our Frequently Asked Questions section below. 
Thank you for increasing the impact of your gift through corporate matching.  Your support helps Pittsburgh Opera continue bringing world-class opera and quality arts education programming to Pittsburgh and beyond.
Pittsburgh Opera Matching Information:Address: 2425 Liberty Ave, Pittsburgh PA 15222Phone: 412-281-0912Email: Torey GricksTax-ID or EIN #: 25-1073139             				WHAT IS A MATCHING GIFT?
				      Employee matching gift programs are corporate giving programs.
For example, if you work for Highmark and donate $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, Highmark’s matching gift program has a minimum gift requirement of $100 and matches your gift at a 1:1 ratio. After you submit your matching gift form, Highmark will effectively double your gift by giving $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, as well.
Retirees may also qualify for a match.
It's a quick and easy way to increase the impact of your gift and leverage your company’s support for Pittsburgh Opera.    
				HOW DO I REQUEST A MATCHING GIFT FROM MY COMPANY TO THE OPERA?

				I GAVE TO THE OPERA A FEW MONTHS AGO. CAN I STILL APPLY FOR A MATCHING GIFT?
				      Yes, it's not too late to apply for a matching gift. Your company may even allow you to submit match requests for 1 year following the date of your gift.

				SYNOPSIS
				      CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA
A village in Sicily, circa 1900. At dawn on Easter Sunday, Turiddu sings in the distance of his love for Lola, wife of the carter Alfio. She and Turiddu had been a couple before he joined the army. When he returned and found her married to Alfio, he seduced Santuzza but now has abandoned her and rekindled his relationship with Lola. Later in the morning, a distraught Santuzza approaches the tavern of Mamma Lucia, Turiddu’s mother, who tells her that her son is away buying wine. But Santuzza knows that Turiddu has been seen during the night in the village. Alfio arrives with a group of men, boasting of his horses—and of Lola. He asks Mamma Lucia if she has any more of her good wine. When she says that Turiddu has gone to get more, Alfio replies that he saw him near his house that same morning. Lucia is surprised, but Santuzza tells her to keep quiet. As the villagers follow the procession to church, Santuzza stays behind and pours out her grief about Turiddu to Mamma Lucia. The old woman expresses her pity, then also leaves for Mass. Turiddu arrives in the piazza. When Santuzza confronts him about his affair with Lola, he denies her accusations. Just then Lola passes by on her way to church. She mocks Santuzza, and Turiddu turns to follow her. Santuzza begs him to stay and implores him not to abandon her. Refusing to listen, Turiddu leaves, and Santuzza curses him. Alfio appears, late for Mass. Santuzza tells him that Lola went to church with Turiddu and reveals that she has been cheating on him. In a rage, Alfio swears to get even and rushes off, leaving behind the now conscience-stricken Santuzza.
Returning from the church the villagers gather at Mamma Lucia’s tavern. Turiddu leads them in a drinking song, but the atmosphere becomes tense when Alfio appears. He refuses Turiddu’s offer of wine and instead challenges him to a knife fight. Turiddu admits his guilt but is determined to go through with the fight, for Santuzza’s sake as well as for his honor. The two men agree to meet outside the village. Alone with his mother, Turiddu begs her to take care of Santuzza if he doesn’t come back, then runs off to the fight. As Mamma Lucia waits anxiously, shouts are heard in the distance. A woman runs in screaming that Turiddu has been killed.
 
PAGLIACCI
PROLOGUE
Tonio the clown announces that what the audience is about to see is a true story and that actors have the same joys and sorrows as other people.
ACT I
The same Sicilian village, 1949. A small theatrical company has just arrived and Canio, the head of the troupe, advertises the night’s performance to the gathered crowd. One of the villagers suggests that Tonio is secretly courting Canio’s young wife, Nedda. Canio warns them all that he will not tolerate any flirting offstage—life and theater are not the same. As the crowd disperses, Nedda is left alone, disturbed by her husband’s jealousy. She looks up to the sky, envying the birds their freedom. Tonio appears and tries to force himself on Nedda, but she beats him back, and he retreats, swearing revenge. In fact, Nedda does have a lover—Silvio, a young peasant, who suddenly appears. The two reaffirm their love, and Silvio persuades Nedda to run away with him that night. Tonio, who has returned and overheard the end of their conversation, alerts Canio, but Silvio manages to slip away unrecognized. Canio violently threatens Nedda, but she refuses to reveal her lover’s name. Beppe, another member of the troupe, restrains Canio, and Tonio advises him to wait until the evening’s performance to catch the culprit. Alone, Canio gives in to his despair—he must play the clown even though his heart is breaking.
ACT II
That evening, the villagers assemble to watch the performance, Silvio among them. Beppe plays Harlequin, who serenades Columbine, played by Nedda. He dismisses her buffoonish servant Taddeo, played by Tonio, and over dinner the two sweethearts plot to poison Columbine’s husband Pagliaccio, played by Canio. When Pagliaccio unexpectedly appears, Harlequin slips away. Taddeo maliciously assures Pagliaccio of his wife’s innocence, which ignites Canio’s jealousy. Forgetting his role and the play, he demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover. She tries to continue with the performance, the audience enthralled by its realism, until Canio snaps. In a fit of rage he stabs Nedda and then Silvio, who rushes to her aid. Turning to the horrified crowd, Tonio announces that the comedy is over.

His escape is her cage.In this groundbreaking new production created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect.Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real.Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy.
 
These performances are sponsored in part by generous gifts from Caroline & Mary Barensfeld and The Galliot Fund.

				SYNOPSIS
				      In the present day, B.F. Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife.
Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet.
Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again.
Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die.
A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night.
Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him.
Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Dec        Volunteering at Pittsburgh Opera
Because opera includes all the arts, it provides rich opportunities to experience and observe artists of all kinds. Volunteers who give their time and expertise at Pittsburgh Opera learn, while "working in the wings," the amazing amount of effort and skill it takes to produce opera.
Pittsburgh Opera occasionally needs volunteers at events and for special projects. During an individual interview, we determine if a volunteer’s interests and skills match Pittsburgh Opera’s needs.
If you are interested in volunteering, email Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, or call her at 412-281-0912 ext. 242.

She lived for art. Would she die for love?When painter Cavaradossi—the lover of Rome’s enchanting diva Floria Tosca—decides to harbor a fugitive of the law, he makes himself and his beloved Tosca a target of the corrupt Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all.Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours. See why Tosca is one of the most powerful operas ever written.These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.        (photo credit: David Bachman)    (photo credit: David Bachman)    (photo credit: David Bachman)    (photo credit: David Bachman)    (photo credit: David Bachman)

				SYNOPSIS
				      ACT I. Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”).
 
ACT II. In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand.
 
ACT III. The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death.

BUILDING
Rental Rates
Our current rental rates can be found on our website: https://www.pittsburghopera.org/facilities/hold-your-event-at-pittsburgh-opera/rental-information
Load-in & Load-out Policy
A full-day rental includes 12 hours from set-up to end of your event, plus one hour for clean-up. Access will be given to Social Tables for lessees to place objects around the space. Pittsburgh Opera event staff will set up the items as noted on Social Tables prior to lessee’s arrival.
Lessees will inform Pittsburgh Opera staff of any rentals associated with their event. Drop off and pick up times must be coordinated prior to the event. Vendor drop offs are allowed the day prior to your event within the hours of 9:30am-1:30pm. Lessee will be charged an additional hourly fee for a ceremony rehearsal or drop off and set up of personal items, décor, etc. on the day prior to the event.
It is preferred that all personal items must be removed from the building at the end of the event, however, if prior arrangements are made, items may be picked up at a later date. Rented items may be left and picked up on the next business day between 9:30am-1:30pm, with approval from Pittsburgh Opera.
Additional Security
The staffing fee for each event covers one (1) security guard, hired by PO, for the duration of your Event Time and one (1) PO staff member.                  
Upper Level of GRW Access
Guests may NOT access the upper level of the GRW. We will allow individuals up to the second level to put up and take down decorations. We will also allow photographer or videographer limited access the upper level.
Restricted Items
The following items are prohibited from use in the George Roland White Studio, Founders’ Room, and other associated spaces: Helium-filled balloons
Confetti, glitter, beads, or similar loose items
Feather boas
Sparklers or other pyrotechnic instruments
Gas/wood-fueled burners (Sternos are permitted)
Hay or straw
Unprotected taper candles
Bubbles or foam machines
Champagne towers or spraying of champagne indoors  
Smoking is not permitted on the Premises, including the garage area. Use of electronic cigarettes is also prohibited. Smoking shall only be permitted at designated areas outside of the garage area as defined by Pittsburgh Opera.
In accordance with Pennsylvania State law, Lessee shall not permit the use of any illegal drugs in or about the Premises at any time.
Guest Arrival
There are two large Pittsburgh Opera signs on Liberty Avenue and two A-frame signs are placed at the entrance and exit of the parking garage. We do recommend that volunteers stand at the entrance and exit to the garage for your guests’ ease of mind. These volunteers can answer questions about parking or the event in general.
VENDORS
Preferred Vendors
Pittsburgh Opera has no requirements about vendors, so you can feel free to use any caterer, DJ, photographer, etc. that best suits your budget and taste. A list of preferred Pittsburgh Opera vendors can be provided upon request.
Kitchen Access
Pittsburgh Opera has a small kitchen that the caterer may use for prep work. Because of poor ventilation, however, this is a warming kitchen and cannot accommodate cooking. If your menu requires on-site cooking, most caterers will set up a kitchen in the parking garage, where ventilation is not a factor.
Alcohol Policy
You are responsible for bringing in your own alcohol for the event, if desired. Many caterers will provide alcohol and bartenders for your event, at your request. Our only stipulation with the bar is that, due to PA liquor laws, you cannot sell alcohol on site, so the bar must be an open bar.
Announcements & Music
Pittsburgh Opera will not provide A/V equipment for your event. If you wish to have music or announcements made, it is recommended to hire a DJ.
AMENITIES
Ice Machine/Ice Storage
Unfortunately, we do not have an ice machine. We do, however, have an ice chest located in the kitchen that can hold approximately 4-5 bags of ice. You will need to provide the ice. If you bring coolers with extra ice, they must be kept in the garage.
Guest Parking
Events have use of our parking garage on a first-come, first-served basis. While we will strive to ensure that at least some of your guests have use of this convenience, full use of the garage is not guaranteed. If our garage is full, other options include street parking (which is metered below 25th Street), the $10 lot at the corner of Penn Avenue and 24th Street (1 block from the Opera), and the $6 garage at the corner of Smallman Street and 24th Street (2 blocks from the Opera). The lot across from the Opera on Liberty Avenue is a private lot and not available for rental. Many rental groups arrange for a shuttle service for their guests, though this is by no means required.
Two of our preferred vendors – D & P Valet and The Hub – can also provide parking services. D & P Valet can be onsite to valet guests’ cars. The Hub will set up an account with the Lessee to allow guest’s parking fees to be billed to the Lessee directly.
Pittsburgh Opera Tables and Chairs
Providing our equipment isn’t being used for another event in the building, the Opera has the following:  
11025651025350 
  
72” round table (seats up to 10 people)60” round tables (seats up to 8 people)30” low round tables (seats up to 4 people)26” high round tables8’ x 24” rectangle tables6’ x 24” rectangular utility tables5’ bar unitsblack leather chairs banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim)banquet chairs (maroon with gold trim)  
Piano Use
Pittsburgh Opera usually keeps a grand piano in each room but they are removed if not being used.   If your group is interested in using a piano, a small piano tuning fee will be added to your final invoice. Pittsburgh Opera does NOT supply a pianist, so you will be required to hire one of your own.
ADMINISTRATIVE
Administrative Fees
$150 insurance fee covers general liability for insurance for the space. If you wish to purchase more coverage or are looking for additional, generic event insurance, then you may purchase additional plans.
$450 staffing fee covers a Pittsburgh Opera staff member to be on-site for the entirety of your rental from set-up to clean-up and a third-party security guard hired by Pittsburgh Opera. PO staff will ensure building systems are working throughout and stay clean during your event, along with basic support of PO equipment.
$150 cleaning fee covers the additional cleaning of the event space, floors, , bathrooms, and kitchen.

Here are some questions people ask us all the time.
Have a question that’s not asked or answered here? Feel free to give us a call at 412-281-0912 during office hours.      
				How much do tickets cost?
				      Click here to explore season ticket options.    
				How long will the opera be?
				      You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources."     
				What's a good show for opera newbies this season?
				      Typically first-timers like to start with classics like The Barber of Seville (coming this October, 2023) or La Traviata (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love. The Passion of Mary Cardwell Dawson (coming April, 2024) may also be up the newcomer's alley, presenting a slice of Pittsburgh history with the familiar music of Carmen.  
You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage.    
				Is it OK to bring kids to the opera?
				       
Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form.
Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative!    
				Is there any special etiquette I should know about?
				      A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too.
If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer!    
				Is Pittsburgh Opera still performing at the Benedum Center?
				      Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage.     
				Can I park near the theater?
				      Here's information about parking near each of our performance venues. 
Parking near the Benedum CenterThe are several parking garages within a few blocks of the Benedum Center. The big blue Theater Square Garage (entrance on 7th St. between Penn Ave and Ft. Duquesne Blvd) - As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are $20, but Pittsburgh Opera subscribers can buy parking vouchers for $15 each. Besides saving money, these come in handy when there’s a lot going on downtown because you're guaranteed a spot. To buy vouchers, call 412-281-0912.
The Smithfield & Liberty garage, 629 Smithfield Street. As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are just $6. 
The 6th & Penn garage on Penn Ave between 6th & 5th, has $15 night/weekend rates as of October 2019. You can get real-time parking availability at ParkPGH.
Parking near CAPA TheaterSince the demolition of the old parking garage at 9th and Penn, the closest sizable lots are: Smithfield & Liberty garage, 629 Smithfield Street. As of October 2019, their evening/weekend rates are just $6.
Convention Center garage, 1000 Fort Duquesne Blvd, enter on 10th Street. As of October 2019, their night rate is $5 and "Event Rate" $13. Parking near Bitz Opera FactoryStreet parking is generally available on Penn Avenue, and there is a surface lot at 24th and Penn, right beside Harp & Fiddle.    
				What time should I arrive for the show?
				      We typically suggest you arrive 30 - 45 minutes before the start time in order to find parking, find your seat, and settle in.    
				How can I learn more about the productions?
				      We’ve got lots of ways to get you tuned in. Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances. You'll hear the story of the opera, some background about the composer, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories. 
Meet the Artists is after each Tuesday performance. Enjoy great coversation as the singers, conductor and General Director Christopher Hahn talk about the production and their experiences. You may be surprised to see how funny and down-to-earth these artists really are.
Can’t wait until showtime? Then tune in to 89.3 FM or visit the WQED-FM website for WQED’s Pittsburgh Opera Preview Show.
Gotta have the information right now? Check out the show page for the opera you’re interested in, and explore! You’ll find the story, music and video, cast biographies, and other features. If that’s still not enough, give us a call during office hours: 412-281-0912, ext. 3.    
				Do you have services for people with visual impairments?
				      Yes! Audio Description is available for people with visual impairments during the second Tuesday performance during the 2020-21 season.
Using hearing devices, you can hear the supertitles read along with descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. We also have Braille and large-print program summaries available.

Striving for accessibility throughout the organization
Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances.
Inclusion at Pittsburgh Opera
Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company.      
				CAPTIONING/SUPERTITLES
				      All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage. These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans".     
				AUDIO COMMENTARY
				      Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory.
Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes.
A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play".   
Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $12.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship.
To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby.    
				ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES
				      Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid.
The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Infrared: Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is audio amplification only. Channel 2 on the Infrared Hearing Devices includes music and Audio Commentary
Inductive Loop: If a patron's hearing aid has a Telecoil or Phone Position setting, the hearing aid can be worn and a special headset with an inductive loop system can be used (and worn around the neck). Infrared hearing devices cannot be used in the ears with a hearing aid. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume.    
				SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION
				      Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter.
To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600.
Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do.

For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby.
Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list.    
				SENSORY WORKSHOPS
				      Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department.

You can read their Safety & Security statement, which includes an updated list of prohibited items, and read their Bag Policy, on their website.
Beware of Ticket Resellers
Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is opera.culturaldistrict.org, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site trustarts.org. If you do not see culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org in the webpage's URL, you are not using our official ticketing website and are likely on a reseller website.
The risks of buying from a reseller include:        You may pay more than face value.    Your tickets may not be real.    Your tickets may not be able to be replaced when lost or stolen.    Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us.    Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information.     Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value. 
Resellers go to great lengths to come up first in Google search results, and often use official-sounding names such as "Ticket Network", "Box Office Ticket Sales", "Ticket Smarter", "Ticket City", and so on. Don't be fooled!

Pittsburgh Opera’s Voice Teacher Ambassador program is a new initiative designed for teachers both locally and beyond to enjoy exclusive benefits, share their perspective, and help continue to spread the operatic joy that Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to bringing to the public. Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of.

Voice Teacher Ambassadors will be asked to share Pittsburgh Opera’s digital season of free operatic performances with their students and, as we return to in-person live theater, encourage their students to visit our stages and experience our productions first hand (special student priced tickets are always available). Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your students.

You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory, you will be given the best seats available at the time they’re issued.

				FAQS - PRICING/BILLING
				      How much does an Opus Pass cost?
The Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass costs $20 a month.
Subscribers can add an Opus Pass Subscription Add On to their traditional seated subscription package for an extra $5 a month. For more information about the Opus Pass Subscription Add On, please see the 'FAQs - Opus Pass Subscription Add On' section below. 
How do I buy an Opus Pass?
You can buy a Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass by calling 412-281-0912 ext. 3, or you can order online. 
How long does my Opus Pass last?
Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are valid for one year from its date of issue. Your Opus Pass will automatically renew unless you take action to make changes or cancel.
When does my Opus Pass 'start'? If you purchase your Opus Pass between June-September 2024, it will activate as of October 1st, in time for the first opera of our 2024-25 season. Your billing cycle will begin in early October.
If you purchase your Opus Pass on or after October 1, 2024, it is valid for one year from the date of purchase. What if I buy an Opus Pass after the season is already underway? 
Since your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes is valid for one year from its date of issue, you will be able to use your Pass for any Pittsburgh Opera performances in the following season that fall within one year of purchase.
For example, if you purchase a Pass in December 2024, you will be able to use it for all our remaining 2024-25 Season performances, as well as our October and November 2024 performances, even though they are part of our 2025-26 season. 
How do you bill me?
Your credit card will be charged once each calendar month.
Patrons who buy an Opus Pass will be charged monthly from date of purchase. 
Can I pay for the whole year upfront?
Yes. If you choose our one-time payment option, you will save $20, i.e. you will get one month free.
My credit card's expiration date is before my Opus Pass expires. What should I do?
Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 with your updated credit card information prior to your card expiring.
Is it possible to cancel my Opus Pass before it expires?
If you need to cancel your Opus Pass before it expires, you can choose to receive a refund for the difference in value between what you've paid so far for your Pass and the normal single ticket face value price of any tickets you redeemed.
For example, if you had been a Passholder for six months and paid $120 for your Pass so far, and you'd redeemed your Pass for one ticket which had a regular price of $110, you would be eligible for a $10 refund. 
If you have redeemed your Pass for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever do that of course!
All future ticket reservations will be forfeited upon cancellation of membership. There are no refunds retroactively after your Pass expires.    
				FAQS - TICKET REDEMPTION
				      How do I redeem my Pass for a ticket to a specific performance?
Simply email us, fill out your Opus Pass Ticket Redemption Form, or call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 as early as five days or as late as 3 hours prior to the performance.
How far in advance can I redeem my Pass for a specific performance?
Ticket redemption opens five days before each performance and is available up to three hours before showtime.
Where will you seat me?
For performances at the Benedum Center, you will be given the best available seats, excluding Zone A. Specific seat assignments are not guaranteed.
Can I request a specific seating location?
Yes. You can specify whether you prefer to sit on the Orchestra Level (i.e. the main floor) or the Balcony Level, whether you prefer to be on House Left, House Right, on or close to an aisle vs. in the middle of a row, etc. You can also request to be seated next to other specific Opus Passholders or ticketholders, e.g. 'Please seat me next to my friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'. If you need an accessible seat, e.g. for a wheelchair, please let us know. Pittsburgh Opera will do our best to honor specific seating requests. But please know that specific seat assignments are not guaranteed, and are subject to availability.
Where do I pick up my tickets?
At Will Call. Please remember to bring photo ID.
What if a performance is already sold out?
If a performance is already sold out when a Passholder tries to redeem their Pass for a ticket, they will have the option of being placed on the Wait List, and will be eligible to use tickets released by other patrons.
What if I end up not being able to attend a performance I redeemed my Pass for?
We understand that unexpected circumstances may prevent you from attending a performance which you've redeemed your Pass for. If that happens, please let us know at least one hour prior to the performance so that we can release your ticket. Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera.    
				FAQS - GENERAL QUESTIONS
				      Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it?
No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets.
I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together?
It depends. If you and your partner always attend the opera together, i.e. you always buy two seats together, and you plan on attending at least three performances this coming season together, then you should buy two Opus Passes - one for you and one for your partner. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass.
If your "+1" guest changes from show to show - sometimes your significant other comes with you, but other times you bring a neighbor, friend, or work colleague - you should not buy two Opus Passes, because each Pass is issued in a specific person's name. Instead, when you redeem your Pass for a specific performance, mention that you need to add on a second ticket. You can purchase additional tickets at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together.  I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? 
No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. 
Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance?
Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together.
I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I?
Yes! Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you.
Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them?
No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund.
Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events?
Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately.     
				FAQS - OPUS PASS SUBSCRIPTION ADD ON
				      I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass?
Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. Subscribers who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price.
Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription?
If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. 
Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly?
Subscribers who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments.  
Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway?
Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost.
If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On?
If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month.

Dec        Hailed as one of the country's leading training programs for young artists, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program provides professional development during a two-year session.
The Program
Each year, exceptional young singers are selected by audition from more than 800 applicants.
While honing their vocal skills and expanding their repertoire, Resident Artist Singers study languages, diction, movement, and acting. Performance opportunities include principal roles in fully-staged Resident Artist productions, comprimario roles and principal cover roles in Pittsburgh Opera mainstage productions.
The Resident Artist Stage Director serves as Director for a resident artist production, Assistant Director for all mainstage operas, and stages Song Shop Concerts and other events throughout the season.
The Resident Artist Pianist serves as a rehearsal pianist, orchestra pit pianist for select productions, accompanies community engagement events, and receives invaluable mentorship from Pittsburgh Opera’s Music Director and Music Staff.
 
Watch this video to hear from current and past Resident Artists, and Pittsburgh Opera Artistic staff, about the program:              
Resident Artists perform comprimario roles on the main stage.   Resident Artists perform lead roles in our baroque and Second Stage productions.   Our Resident Artists perform in our Song Shop concerts, which are free and open to everyone.    
Resident Artists are also the headliners at our formal fundraising events such as Maecenas and Diamond Horseshoe Ball.    
The Resident Artists entertain kids and their families at Children's Hospital at holiday time.

We train teachers of all grade levels to integrate arts so thousands of students can enjoy opera.         Workshops for Educators
Our signature program is a unique, fun, and stimulating professional learning opportunity for teachers of all grade levels in all content areas.
Workshop topics include the five 2024–2025 season operas plus additional arts integration materials so that teachers have additional resources to use in their classes. Each workshop is recorded so that participants can attend live or at a later time. We include live presentations and/or performances by resident artists. And, we provide some of the workshop materials in advance for participants to explore at their convenience, so the actual “live” workshop time is short and engaging.
The 1.5 hour workshops are on Saturday mornings from 10:30 am–12:00 pm via Zoom, with a one hour optional networking time afterward.
There is no cost to attend the workshop. Pre-registration is required a week in advance by emailing: megan@pittsburghopera.org

In return, Opera Academy members document how they use opera in their classes.

				SUPERNUMERARY OPPORTUNITIES
				      Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Opportunities
Have you ever wanted to dance with Carmen, serve at the Café Momus, or simply be onstage at the Benedum Center? Apply to become a supernumerary!
 
What is a Supernumerary? A Supernumerary—or “super”— is a non-singing, non-speaking role, much like an extra in film and television. Supers may perform as townspeople, guards, servants, and much more, providing silent but essential support to Pittsburgh Opera’s productions. Supers will share the stage with internationally renowned artists, work with celebrated directors and conductors, and experience the magic of opera from the Benedum Center stage.
Stage experience is helpful but not required, and all super positions are filled on a voluntary basis. Individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities are welcome and encouraged to apply.
Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary General Information
Our larger productions will be presented at the Benedum Center in Downtown Pittsburgh. Staging rehearsals will take place at Pittsburgh Opera’s Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip District.
 
Pittsburgh Opera’s Supernumeraries are enthusiastic and dependable. Supers are required to attend approximately 10-15 rehearsals, generally nights and weekends, as well as all performances. The occasional daytime rehearsal may be scheduled.
Supers are paid a small honorarium of $100 and receive two (2) complimentary tickets, subject to availability. We are not able to offer housing or union credit for these roles.
How do I apply?Follow the link below to complete an application. No phone calls please.
Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Application
 
Please complete the application and submit a recent full-body photo. Applicants will be added to the Pittsburgh Opera Database and will be contacted via email as opportunities become available. 
 
If it has been over two years since you last applied, you can update your information by filling out a new application.
If you would like to remove your name from the Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Database, please email kmartin@pittsburghopera.org.

Opera is a multi-faceted art form, rich in fascinating history and colorful personalities. There is always something more to learn about opera, and Pittsburgh Opera provides a wide variety of programs to help you explore individual operas and the field in general. 
Education Programs at Pittsburgh Opera translate this multi-disciplinary art form into relevant, engaging, and enriching experiences for educators, students, schools, families, and adults. Pittsburgh Opera’s Education programs were recognized as a finalist at the 2019 International Opera Awards. We were the only opera company from the United States among the finalists. We invite you to join us to learn more.
More than ever, we believe that: We all need art in our lives.
Kids need arts education to balance and enrich their learning experiences.

Dec                  Opera Connections guests from Pittsburgh Faison ES at a performance of Il Trovatore at the Benedum Center.
Opera Connections
Connecting the opera to the community, this program provides opportunities for parents and children from select Pittsburgh neighborhoods to attend opera performances together—to experience art as a family. At Pittsburgh Opera, we believe in reaching out to our friends who might not normally be able to attend arts performances, and we believe in preparing them to attend through pre-performance workshops. What better way to experience the magic of opera than to attend with a family member!
To get more information about opera programs for families, please contact Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, at 412-281-0912, ext. 242.

Why give monthly?
1. Consistent Support: Monthly, sustaining giving allows you to make a gift that fits into your budget and provides Pittsburgh Opera with a stable, predictable source of funding. We can focus on creating the music while you focus on enjoying it!
2. Convenience and Flexibility: Monthly giving is hassle-free. Once you set up your recurring donation, your contribution will be automatically deducted from your chosen payment method each month. You have full control over the amount you give, and you can easily adjust, pause, or stop your donation at any time.
3. Deeper Impact: Your monthly gift accumulates over time to make a significant impact and can easily add up to a substantial annual contribution. This allows us to both budget our resources more efficiently.
4. Community of Supporters: You join a group of creative individuals who share a passion for opera and the arts. Connect with fellow supporters and be part of a vibrant network that celebrates the transformational power of the performing arts.

Antony Walker, Music Director Announces auditions for Section Viola

 Thursday, November 14, 2024
PITTSBURGH OPERA INFORMATION
The Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra performs up to four main stage productions (Benedum Center) per season, plus up to 2 smaller-venue productions. Instrumentation is determined on a per-production basis. A typical production is 9 services: 5 rehearsals and 4 performances.
The successful Section Viola candidate will be offered a contract for PITTSBURGH OPERA productions beginning in the 2025-26 season. Dates and productions are TBA.
CLICK HERE TO APPLY
Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right not to invite any candidate who does not meet the highest professional standards.
AUDITION REPERTOIRE
Audition location: Bitz Opera Factory, Pittsburgh Opera headquarters.
2425 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222    
				SUPERNUMERARY OPPORTUNITIES
				      Pittsburgh Opera Supernumerary Opportunities
Have you ever wanted to dance with Carmen, serve at the Café Momus, or simply be onstage at the Benedum Center? Apply to become a supernumerary!
 
What is a Supernumerary? A Supernumerary—or “super”— is a non-singing, non-speaking role, much like an extra in film and television. Supers may perform as townspeople, guards, servants, and much more, providing silent but essential support to Pittsburgh Opera’s productions. Supers will share the stage with internationally renowned artists, work with celebrated directors and conductors, and experience the magic of opera from the Benedum Center stage.

However, we will be posting comparable bonus content in our Facebook and YouTube chats during the free livestreams.

Funding for the Pittsburgh Opera Mobile App is generously provided by an OPERA America Innovation Grant from the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, and by the Hillman Foundation.       
				APP BACKGROUND
				      Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events. The app is powered by Instant Encore, the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe.
In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note®. Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center, LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e.g. text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances. Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel. Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences.
Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®. We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined, and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season.
Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons. After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users. With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season. We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time.

Dec                  Pittsburgh Opera is offering free childcare to children ages 2-12 at the Sunday matinee performances of tosca and Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci at the Benedum Center.
The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service.
There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance.
The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance.
Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life.
This program is generously funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation.      
				FAQS
				      Where is the childcare provided?
The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service.
What are the age limits? 
The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge.
Do I need to buy a ticket for my child who will be using the childcare service?
Yes, but it's free. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Please use the process shown in the "How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. 
Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done?
Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the "Liability Waiver" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance.
When do I drop off and pick up my child?
The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS.
After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts?
No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance.
Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use?
Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. 
Will there be food provided?
Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. 
What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? 
Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. 
My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication?
No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.    
				HOW TO ADD CHILDCARE TO YOUR TICKET PURCHASE
				      Step 1 - After selecting a ticket to either Tosca or Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the "click here if you would like to add free child care" link.

Dec        Since our founding in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera has enriched the Pittsburgh region by bringing live, world-class opera to our community. We have long been committed to making opera accessible to a diverse audience, but we recognize that a more focused outlook is necessary to ensure that our organization reflects the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA), in our public offerings as well as internally.
Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect - respect for all stories, voices, experiences, and contributions. We aim to reflect this culture both through our leadership structure, programming choices, and employment policies, as well as through our interactions with our audience and the larger community.
We recognize and celebrate the rich cultural history of opera while also acknowledging that the classic repertoire is largely European and does not include the perspective or experience of many marginalized communities. Because of this history, it has been especially essential that Pittsburgh Opera recognizes these biases and continues to bring more diverse voices both to our stage and to our staff. For many years, Pittsburgh Opera has provided a platform for contemporary works on the main stage as well as part of our Second Stage Project. Through world premieres such as 2017’s The Summer King, about baseball legend Josh Gibson, and productions of As One and 27, we continue to showcase work by diverse composers and librettists, sung by diverse artists, and supported by a diverse artistic and administrative staff.
In addition, Pittsburgh Opera embraces a continued commitment to growth and conversation, as outlined by the following principles: Inclusion: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to fostering an environment of mutual respect and a culture that values individual voices.
Diversity: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to encouraging diversity, and to engaging the larger community in order to ensure that our organization reflects the population we serve.
Equity: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to implementing policies of equity to ensure an even playing field for all.
Accessibility: Pittsburgh Opera is committed to integrating accessibility principles at all levels, ensuring that those with visual, physical, sensory, or other accessibility needs can experience opera without barriers.

Dec        An Important Campaign Message from General Director Christopher Hahn:         
Inspired by the power of the human voice to change lives, five visionary women founded Pittsburgh Opera, now the seventh oldest opera company in the United States. Today, Forever, our 80th Anniversary Campaign, honors their foresight and legacy as we prepare for our next 80 years.
Pittsburgh Opera has a significant record of excellence, authenticity, and passion. The superb quality of our on-stage productions, Resident Artists program, and community engagement initiatives is recognized internationally.
We are among the very few opera companies that owns our facilities for rehearsal, costumes, and administration. Our building was built in 1869 as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory, which perfectly illustrates Pittsburgh Opera’s deep and resonant connection to our region and our past.

In April 2008, Pittsburgh Opera moved into its new home at 2425 Liberty Avenue in the Strip District. The building not only has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869 – but gives Pittsburgh Opera a bright future.
In 2021, in grateful recognition of Francois Bitz's exceptional generosity and long affiliation with the company, Pittsburgh Opera was proud to re-name its headquarters in the Strip District, the Bitz Opera Factory.
At 45,000 square feet, the $8 million project features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes.Pittsburgh Opera’s building was designed by IKM. A new wrap-around metal, neon, and LEED sign was designed by Bill Kolano. Contractor is Massaro Corporation.       The Bitz Opera Factory is the original home of the George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory. The air brake revolutionized railroad transportation.   Guests enter the Bitz Opera Factory through this casual, welcoming lobby.   The "Garage" Conference room has corrugated siding and a clear glass garage door entry.   The George R. White Opera Studio is the home of many of our community events, including Brown Bag concerts.   Our Five Founders are honored with a memorial plaque in our most-used public space.   Our Wardrobe department stores everything from shoes to corsets to scarves to jewelry, and manufactures costumes when needed.   The wig and makeup area, located within the Wardrobe department.   The Library holds a treasure trove of books, scores, libretti, recordings, industry magazines, and more.   Detail from the top of George Westinghouse's metal safe.   Pittsburgh Opera is LEED Certified Silver in the Operations and Maintenance category.   Pittsburgh Opera is LEED Certified Silver in the Operations and Maintenance category.
