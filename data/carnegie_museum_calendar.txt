The event 'KAWS + WarholWarhol' is held during May 18, 2024-Jan 20, 2025 at The Andy Warhol Museum. Description: Current ExhibitionKAWS + WarholMay 18, 2024–January 20, 2025KAWS + Warholexhibition view at The Andy Warhol Museum.Exhibition DetailsThrough Monday, January 20, 2025In celebration of its 30thanniversary, The Warhol presentsKAWS + Warhol, the first exhibition to examine the dark themes present in the work of both artists. From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time.KAWS will also respond to Warhol’s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America’s most loved cereal boxes including Reese’s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol’s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children.In response to The Warhol’s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.KAWS + Warholis presented byMajor support provided byJim Spencer & Michael Lin, and Kathe & Jim Patrinos.Generous support provided byMedia SponsorPublicationKAWS + WarholA never-before-seen look at the striking thematic parallels between KAWS and Andy Warhol, two of the most iconic artists of our timeAs celebrated artists that draw from popular culture, KAWS and Andy Warhol are known for creating art that is approachable beyond the confines of the traditional art world. While at first glance, both artists’ works often appear celebratory and joyful, they share a number of dark common threads beneath the surface: tragedy as spectacle and meditations on death and dying. When these two bold bodies of work are juxtaposed, that connection is made explicit and powerful.This book highlights the artistic intersection of KAWS and Warhol, featuring their takes on death and disaster, advertising, nostalgia, abstraction, skulls, and self-portraiture. Accompanying a major exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum that will travel internationally, it presents some of the most standout and analogous works from two of the most popular artists of all time.Foreword by Patrick Moore, with an interview by Laurie Simmons and essays by Thomas Crow and Marianne DobnerPublished by Monacelli, a Phaidon company, 2024$69.95Buy Now, opens new tabExhibition HighlightsSlide1of13Andy Warhol,Ambulance Disaster, 1964-65, Contribution Dia Center for the Arts, ©The Andy Warhol Foundation, Inc.KAWS,COMPANION 2020, 2020, © KAWSKAWS,GONE, 2018, © KAWSAndy Warhol,Train, 1983, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.KAWS,M2 2000, © KAWS, Photo Farzad OwrangAndy Warhol,Little Electric Chair, 1964-65, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.KAWS and General Mills,Franken Berry Limited Edition Cereal Box, 2022, © KAWS, Photo Brad BridgersAndy Warhol,Moon Explorer Robot, 1983, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.IAndy Warhol,Blow Job(film still), 1964, © The Andy Warhol Museum, a museum of Carnegie Institute.

How do we share our meals? Can the spaces we inhabit daily help us better nurture one another? How might the design of a living room or a kitchen relate to—and empower—a broader sense of community?For Tatiana Bilbao (born 1972) and her Mexico City practiceTatiana Bilbao Estudio, architecture results from research that includes exploratory exhibitions. In this exhibition, five of the galleries are assigned an individual room typology—kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and garden. The architects associate each room type with current projects, revealing, for instance, the role of communal kitchens in a residential building in Mexico City or the way small gardens coexist with houses in St. Louis, MO. These relationships offer new possibilities for privacy and publicness.City of Roomscommunicates an approach to architecture filled with incident and capable of change across time. Tatiana Bilbao Estudio’s vision, research, and experimental practice welcome us into an interdependent, vital, and mutually supportive urban fabric, a proverbial city of rooms.Tatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Roomsis organized by Raymund Ryan, curator-at-large, Heinz Architectural Center.Read, Watch, ListenThe Architecture Is PresentEssaysRead, Watch, ListenThe Architecture Is PresentEssaysEvents and ProgramsTatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Rooms Opening CelebrationSat., Sept. 21, 3 p.m.Talks and LecturesSupportThe programs of the Heinz Architectural Center are made possible by the generosity of the Drue Heinz Trust.Generous support for the exhibition is provided by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.Carnegie Museum of Art’s exhibition program is supported by the Carnegie Museum of Art Exhibition Fund and The Fellows of Carnegie Museum of Art.Carnegie Museum of Art is supported by The Heinz Endowments and Allegheny Regional Asset District.

The survey welcomes visitors to journey through six decades of Kuhn’s deeply personal, rhythmic practice grounded in perpetual experimentation on her potter’s wheel.Beate Kuhn: Turnoffers an intimate view into the artist’s contemplative process and exploration of form, expression, and contrast through works created at the beginning of her career until the final years of her life.At the intersection of Modernist painting, sculpture, and studio pottery, Kuhn found creative resonance for her practice. The beautiful and sublime aspects of nature were another muse as she channeled brilliant assemblages of parts: seed pods, succulents, exoskeletons, fungi, and shells. Throughout her career, Kuhn skillfully played with contrasts in her artworks: shiny and matte, light and dark, convex and concave, stillness and movement, individual and collective, birth, death, and decay.Beate Kuhn: Turnis organized by Rachel Delphia, Alan G. and Jane A. Lehman Curator of Decorative Arts and Design, with Alyssa Velazquez, assistant curator.About the ArtistBorn in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1927, Beate Kuhn grew up in an artistic family living in the shadows of World War II. Just 17 when the war ended, she embraced newfound mobility and educational opportunity, studying art history and ceramics and bicycling across the European continent to view museum exhibitions. From 1949 to 1951, Kuhn learned to throw on the potter’s wheel at the Werkkunstschule (School of Applied Arts) Wiesbaden, a training that would become integral to her artistic practice. From 1951 to 1953, she furthered her ceramic education at the Werkkunstschule Darmstadt, where she perfected techniques for mixing and applying clay slips, engobes, and glazes.Kuhn launched her career as a studio potter from a shared workshop in Lottstetten, near the Swiss border. She experimented with abstract female figures—assembled from vessel forms and embellished with colorful surfaces—and designed objects for the internationally renowned porcelain manufacturer Rosenthal in Selb. In 1957, Kuhn built a home and studio in Düdelsheim, near Frankfurt, on the property of her friend and fellow Darmstadt potter, Karl Scheid. New contexts, materials, and facilities contributed to a transformation of her art. By the mid-1960s, Kuhn’s work had shifted away from the utilitarian—vases, cups, and plates—toward sculptural objects comprised of these essential forms.Read, Watch, ListenBeate Kuhn: Ceramics Between Painting and SculptureEssaysBeate Kuhn StudioVideosBeate Kuhn: TurnA PlaylistPlaylistRead, Watch, ListenBeate Kuhn: Ceramics Between Painting and SculptureEssaysBeate Kuhn StudioVideosBeate Kuhn: TurnA PlaylistPlaylistEvents and ProgramsBeate Kuhn: Turn Members Exclusive EventSun., June 30, 10 a.m.MembersNature and ClaySat., Aug. 24, 11 a.m.WorkshopsIn Conversation: Patsy Cox, Jing Huang, and Jolie NgoThurs., Oct. 24, 6:30 p.m.Talks and Lectures⏸Scoring the Works of Beate KuhnSun., Dec. 1, 1 p.m.PerformanceLimited Edition Letterpress PrintDesigned and Printed in Germany, 1968Beate Kuhn and her circle of six fellow ceramic artists hired Peter M.

In this exhibition, place may be an environment, a material experience, or a memory to suggest notions of belonging and transformation. Through material explorations, six Pittsburgh-based artists engage with personal narratives to reveal family histories, childhood memories, and expressions of the landscape and architecture that traverse past and present moments.

Ngo is revitalizing the metaphoric potential of the vessel form by utilizing clay 3d printing, to create bright cyborgian pottery objects that acknowledge early ceramic traditions while smiling towards the future. Working with tools that are digitally forward, she is deeply engaged in exploring the tension between past and future, probing the synergy between handmade arts and technology. Maintaining a sense of tactility, intimacy and sensitivity often achieved in traditional handworks is paramount to the practice. She lovingly dresses these familiar forms with hand painted geometric patterns or hazy gradients and affixes embellishments all over their surface to bring the hand back into the process. This interplay of the machine and the hand results in creation of objects that resist definition.She received her BFA in Ceramics from Rhode Island School of Design and her MFA in Ceramic art from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University.Related ExhibitionBeate Kuhn: TurnJune 29–Dec. 1, 2024Beate Kuhn (1927–2015) was a German sculptor known for her rhythmic ensembles of deconstructed, ceramic forms such as discs, cylinders, cones, and spheres.

The films in this program focus on architecture, cities, and elements of the built environment transient, immortalized, or willfully forgotten.Buildings, both ostentatious and banal, can transcend space and time through scripting and art direction. Cities are passed off as other cities, sometimes in other countries. Architecture not only reflects the culture, geography, and class that delivered it, but it can also insinuate morality, psychology, and oppression.

Intonation can reverse the meaning of a phrase, and there are ways to communicate without words. “Loud silences of pain, defiance, endurance, poetics. A silence that sings refusal,” observes Jonelle Twum.Speech trailing off, indicating words left unsaid; perhaps doubt setting in… Lapses of time, a pause (dot, dot, dot) An indeterminate amount of words omitted or disappeared […]“What is liberation when so much has already been taken?” asks Suneil Sanzgiri’s father. He tours a virtual rendering of their ancestral home created with the same technology used by mining companies before their toxic extraction in the region.Other phantoms: culture that can’t be touched, can’t be held, evoked by Jesse Chun’s sojourn through the Intangible Heritage archives, interspersed with a letter to her late grandmother. Camille Henrot mashes up the most common form of myth, usually orally passed down, of how the universe formed. Origin stories followed by cataclysms, with a world after humans visualized by David Blandy in collaboration with teenagers and young adults in North West London. And the world starts anew, again. Elliptical, ellipses.“We are here because you were there.” Ambalavaner Sivanandan’s aphorism is an evergreen explanation of migration that is a legacy of colonialism.Sites include: the filmmakers’ ancestral lands in Ghana and Goa, the Intangible Heritage archives of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in Paris, the collection storage of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and the roleplaying game The World After.RegistrationCarnegie Museum of Art Film Series: [...]Adult012345678910$10Members:$8Student012345678910$8Buy TicketsSeason PassNew this year–save big with the Carnegie Museum of Art Film Series Season Pass!

The event 'Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World is a MysteryArt' is held during Jan 18, 2025-Jun 1, 2025 at Carnegie Museum of Art. Description: ← What’s on ViewGertrude Abercrombie:The Whole World Is a MysteryScaife Gallery 1Jan. 18–June 1, 2025Gertrude Abercrombie (American, 1909–1977) was a critical figure in the midcentury Chicago art scene and a creative force who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings populated with objects and figures of personal significance. With a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary, and a restrained palette, she created potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. Cats, owls, snails, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells, forking paths, and masked figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of wistful introspection and emotional struggle. Drawing consistently on her own dreams as source material, Abercrombie said, “The whole world is a mystery.”This exhibition is co-organized by Carnegie Museum of Art and Colby College Museum of Art and presents a rare opportunity for museum visitors to appreciate—in significant depth—Abercrombie’s highly personal language that draws on surrealist and magic realism approaches to probe deeply into the nature of things. Featuring loans from important institutional and private collections,Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mysteryis the most comprehensive museum presentation of the artist’s work to date.Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mysteryis curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J.

About Girls of Steel In 2010, the Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon University started a program to help close the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The program began with 24 girls from 12 different schools. Today, a robust pipeline of programs, mentors, and outreach activities encourages girls and underrepresented youth, starting as young as age size, to explore STEM before gender stereotypes about technological ability and interest set in. More than 175 students participate from schools across the Pittsburgh region.  For more information about Girls of Steel, visit their website.

Join the History Center and the Veterans Breakfast Club for a storytelling event honoring the strength and sacrifice of women during war time, from the battlefield to the home front.  Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives.  This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences.  The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition, A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime.  Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.  Admission The program is free with advance registration. Please register in advance online.  For additional questions, please contact programs@heinzhistorycenter.org.

The Nationality and Heritage Rooms are designated as historic landmarks by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation.  The NRIEP also represents the University’s ongoing engagement with the regional community through the Nationality and Heritage Room Committees. The committees provide financial support to Pitt students to undertake global learning experiences in the summer, and they organize intercultural programming on campus that engages Pitt students, faculty, and staff with members of the community across generations.
