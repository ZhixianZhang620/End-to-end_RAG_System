Manfred Honeck
Music Director
Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s
          leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations
          receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the
          Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the
          2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home
          and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural
          ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include
          Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major
          venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg
          Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival,
          Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads
          the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour,
          starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the
          prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus.
Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively
          documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring
          works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,
          Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding
          reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the
          orchestra won the GRAMMY® for "Best Orchestral Performance" in 2018.
          The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with
          Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical
          acclaim.
Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the
          University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a
          member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna
          State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a
          conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination
          to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his
          conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of
          the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the
          Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize
          in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of
          the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian
          National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic
          Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the
          Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he
          was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,
          following decades of close collaboration.
Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his
          four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he
          conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,
          Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses
          such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la
          Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg
          Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new
          staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In
          autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, 
          leading a revival of Mozart’sIdomeneo. Beyond the
          podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,
          including Janáček’sJenůfa, Strauss’sElektra, Dvořák’sRusalkaas
          well as Puccini'sTurandotwhich he regularly performs around the
          globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’sSalome, was premiered
          by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023.
As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading
          international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,
          Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,
          Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw
          Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di
          Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States,
          he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York
          Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los
          Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony
          Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic
          Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty
          years.
In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging
          programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all
          four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will
          return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony,
          Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and
          Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's
          anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on
          the music of this composer.
Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in
          the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by
          the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International
          Classical Music Awards declared him "Artist of the Year".

Melia P. Tourangeau
President & CEO
Randi & L. Van V. Dauler, Jr. President & CEO Chair
Melia Tourangeau began her tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra when she was appointed President & CEO in May of 2015, the first woman and the youngest CEO in the Symphony’s 124-year history. Tourangeau’s personal and professional commitment to creating deep and meaningful connections between music, musicians and the community is a hallmark of her leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of America’s most distinguished orchestras.
Soon after her arrival, Tourangeau led the revival of a strategic planning process that has heightened the orchestra’s artistic excellence with innovative concerts, partnerships, premieres, and debuts; moved the organization toward financial stability, including growing the annual fund by 17%; fostered closer cooperation between the board, musicians, staff and volunteers; and deepened the orchestra’s community relationships and reach with new programming and digital technology. She is currently leading a new initiative to promote diversity and inclusion across the organization, with patrons, and with the community. Under Tourangeau’s leadership, the Pittsburgh Symphony has extended the contract of its Music Director, Manfred Honeck, welcomed ten new musicians to the Orchestra and brought new distinguished members of the community to the Board. She successfully led negotiations for a new contract with members of the Orchestra. Tourangeau has represented the orchestra on several highly acclaimed domestic and international tours, enhancing the orchestra’s international reputation. During her tenure, the orchestra’s illustrious recording history has been underscored with numerous GRAMMY Awards and nominations, including the award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2018.
Tourangeau came to the Pittsburgh Symphony from the Utah Symphony | Utah Opera (USUO) in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she served as President & CEO beginning April 2008. Prior to the USUO, Tourangeau worked for the Grand Rapids Symphony in Michigan, beginning as education director in January 1997, being promoted to director of operations in 1999, then vice president and general manager before being named CEO in 2005. Prior to that, she was the education coordinator at the Akron Symphony Orchestra.
She received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994 from the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music with a major in piano performance and a minor in musicology. In April 2007, she received a master’s degree in public administration with an emphasis on nonprofit leadership from Grand Valley State University.
Tourangeau is a member of and serves on the Board of the Pittsburgh Chapter of Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and the Pittsburgh Forum of International Women’s Forum. She and her husband, Michael, live in the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh with their two children.

Frequently Asked Questions
Pre-Performance
How can I order tickets?
Tickets for most events are on sale 24 hours/day from ouronline calendar. The Heinz Hall Box Office hours are Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 PM, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Tickets may be purchased by calling 412.392.4900 Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 pm, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Services charges apply to phone and Internet orders.
When can I arrive for concerts?
Our doors open one hour and 15 minutes prior to classical concerts and one hour prior for all other performances. For a relaxing and enjoyable experience, we encourage you to arrive early, particularly if you need to stop at the box office.
How do I print my tickets at home?
If you selected to print your tickets at home in the purchase path, you can follow theinstructions hereto print them.
What are your security policies?
Entrance Security PolicyAll audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment.Bag and Personal Belongings PolicyHeinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances.Costume PolicyHeinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music ofStar Wars) in costume.
What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system?In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances.
What if I don't want to go through the scanner?An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check.
Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women?The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check.
Is screening the the same at every concert or event?As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances.
What makes the system "smart" and what will you do with the video images?The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall.
What should I wear to concerts?
There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable.
May I bring my children?
Introducing small children to music is important to the PSO and we welcome young children to our youth concerts and Fiddlesticks Family Concerts. Children, approximately age six and over, are welcome at all performances with a purchased ticket (please see Safely Together for current mask and vaccination requirements). The Latecomer's Gallery and lobby video monitors are always options for restless children.
Will there be dinner service in the Mozart Room?
We do not anticipate the Mozart Room reopening in the near future. Please patronize ourdining partners around Heinz Hall.
Do you have a pre-concert "rush" program?
Yes. Beginning two hours prior to most BNY Mellon Grand Classics and PNC Pops performances, students and seniors (age 62+) may purchase discounted rush tickets. Rush tickets are subject to availability and are restricted to certain seating sections. Students and seniors must present valid identification and may purchase one discounted ticket per person. Please note that rush pricing is subject to change. In order to guarantee seating availability, we suggest purchasing tickets prior to the day of the concert you wish to attend. Please note that the PSO offers discounted student and senior subscriptions, which offer the best savings as well as exclusive benefits. For more information on students and senior subscriptions, pleaseclick here.
Can I organize a group for a concert?
Absolutely. With a group ticket purchase you receive discounted tickets, priority seats, personalized service and free reception space. For more information, call 412.392.4819 or visit our website at pittsburghsymphony.org/groups
Are there any other services that I should be aware of?
The Concierge Service, in the Entrance Lobby, is available to assist with information about Heinz Hall, the Cultural District and area attractions and to help with dining, hotel, entertainment and transportation concerns as well as lost and found.
Where can I find Heinz Hall policies?
Heinz Hall policies can be foundon our website.
Can I check my coat?
Coin-operated lockers are located on the Lower and Gallery levels.
How will I find parking?
Pittsburgh's Cultural District can be very busy but guaranteed prepaid parking is available to all ticket holders in the Sixth & Penn garage across from Heinz Hall. You may purchase prepaid parking when you order your tickets. If you have a smartphone, the ParkPGH app helps you to locate available garage parking near the Cultural District on the go.
Performance
When should I applaud?
Applause is usually appropriate at the end of a piece (when the conductor lowers his hands). In a multi-movement work, it is customary to wait until the end of the last movement to applaud, so as not to break the concentration of the performers.
What if I have to cough?
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra provides complimentary cough drops at the concierge desk located in the entrance lobby.
May I take pictures?
Unless otherwise announced in the program and at the concert, the use of still, video and digital cameras or audio recording equipment is strictly prohibited at all times in the concert hall. You are more than welcome to take photos and video in the lobbies and garden area of Heinz Hall.
What if I arrive late?
There is a Latecomer's Gallery, located behind the Main Floor, which affords patrons who arrive after the beginning of a concert the opportunity to enjoy the performance until they can be seated. Latecomers will be seated at suitable intervals during the program, at the discretion of the conductor. The Latecomer's Gallery is also available for parents with younger children.

Ravel’s Piano Concerto
Ravel’s Piano Concerto
Performances
OCT 18FRI 7:30 PM
OCT 20SUN 2:30 PM
The Program
BARTÓK: Suite fromThe Miraculous MandarinRAVEL: Piano Concerto in GSIBELIUS: Symphony No. 4
About this Performance
Bartok’sThe Miraculous Mandarintells of a girl forced to lure a wealthy Mandarin to his tragic fate.  Its theme of the dark passions between men and women is as gripping—and controversial—as when it first premiered. Tom Borrow, a fast-rising artist of the new generation of virtuoso soloists, debuts with his signature work—Ravel’s terrifically entertaining and jazzy Piano Concerto. Concluding the concert is Sibelius’ darkly atmospheric and gloriously menacing Fourth Symphony.
The Artists

Jukka-Pekka Saraste has established himself as one of the outstanding conductors of his generation, demonstrating remarkable musical depth and integrity.

An artist of exceptional versatility and breadth and renowned for his objective approach, he feels a special affinity with the sound and style of late Romantic music. He maintains a particularly strong connection to the works of Beethoven, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Stravinsky and Sibelius and is internationally celebrated for his interpretations of Mahler.

The symphonic cycles of Sibelius, Brahms and Beethoven were exceptionally well received. Previously, from 2006 to 2013, Jukka-Pekka Saraste was Music Director and Chief Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. He was subsequently appointed Conductor Laureate, the very first such title bestowed by the orchestra. Earlier positions include the principal conductorships of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, where he is now Conductor Laureate, and Toronto Symphony Orchestra. He also served as Principal Guest Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Artistic Advisor of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. He founded the Finnish Chamber Orchestra, where he remains the Artistic Advisor. Last but not least, Jukka-Pekka Saraste is a founding member of the LEAD!

The chief music critic of theIsrael Broadcasting Corporation, Yossi Schifmann, hailed his performance as "brilliant... outstanding", ending his review with the words, "Tom Borrow is already a star and we will all surely hear more about him". Following this successful series Tom was further presented by the IPO in gala concerts held in London and Mexico City, and reinvited for a second subscription series. Later that year,International Pianomagazine named him their ‘One To Watch’ and soon afterwards,Gramophonegave him the same accolade (“an exciting young pianist...individuality and elegance").

Following this successful series Tom was further presented by the IPO in gala concerts held in London and Mexico City, and reinvited for a second subscription series.

The Program
BARTÓK: Suite fromThe Miraculous MandarinRAVEL: Piano Concerto in GSIBELIUS: Symphony No. 4
About this Performance
Bartok’sThe Miraculous Mandarintells of a girl forced to lure a wealthy Mandarin to his tragic fate.  Its theme of the dark passions between men and women is as gripping—and controversial—as when it first premiered. Tom Borrow, a fast-rising artist of the new generation of virtuoso soloists, debuts with his signature work—Ravel’s terrifically entertaining and jazzy Piano Concerto. Concluding the concert is Sibelius’ darkly atmospheric and gloriously menacing Fourth Symphony.
