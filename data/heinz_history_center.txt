About Girls of Steel
In 2010, the Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon University started a program to help close the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The program began with 24 girls from 12 different schools. Today, a robust pipeline of programs, mentors, and outreach activities encourages girls and underrepresented youth, starting as young as age size, to explore STEM before gender stereotypes about technological ability and interest set in. More than 175 students participate from schools across the Pittsburgh region.

					OPEN NOW!
				     
From pioneering investigative journalism to leading their country to Olympic gold, Western Pennsylvania women have made an immeasurable impact in America, but too often, their stories have been overlooked.    Reserve Tickets      
The History Center flips the script and takes an unprecedented deep dive into the lives of these fierce and unflappable women who helped change the world inside a major exhibition, A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh.
Take an interactive, thematic journey through women’s history from the early 1800s to modern day that showcases the stories of entrepreneurs and activists, artists and athletes, scientists and inventors, and changemakers and barrier breakers. Through more than 300 artifacts, immersive experiences, and striking archival images, A Woman’s Place reveals how women have made Pittsburgh and the world a better place.
Explore rare artifacts like the small handbag carried around the world in 1889 by legendary journalist Nellie Bly, who traveled the globe in just 72 days, more than a week faster than Jules Verne’s fictional character Phileas Fogg in “Around the World in 80 Days.” 
Discover the stories of “real life” Rosie the Riveters, from the Western Pennsylvanians who worked the mills during World War II and helped inspire the iconic Rosie poster, to the modern day “Girls of Steel” – the all-girls robotics team at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Exhibit highlights include:  Clothing and textiles from the 1830s through today, including the inauguration dress worn by Sophie Masloff – the first and only female mayor of Pittsburgh – and a costume from the National Negro Opera Company 
Original sketches from Peggy Owens Skillen, who helped to create the modern version of the iconic PBS show “Sesame Street” 
Protest posters, buttons, and other objects that tell the story of women’s suffrage and how Pittsburghers like Lucy Kennedy Miller and Winifred Meek Morris fought for the right to vote 
A special section on athletes featuring the Olympic jersey of basketball legend and McKeesport native Swin Cash and Suzie McConnell Serio’s WNBA jersey A League of Their Own
A Woman’s Place now features a rare game-worn uniform from the inaugural season of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. On loan from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, the cotton uniform was worn by Cincinnati, Ohio, native Betsy Jochum of the South Bend (Ind.) Blue Sox. One of the original 60 players in the AAGPBL, Jochum spent her entire career (1943-1948) with the Blue Sox, leading the league in hits in 1943 and 1944 with a .296 average. Jochum’s uniform is on view alongside her leather baseball glove, cleats, and additional artifacts on loan from the Smithsonian.
Extended by popular demand, the A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh exhibit will be on view through Jan. 20, 2025.

Affectionately known as “Gramps,” this is the oldest surviving Bantam jeep.  The U.S. Army donated Gramps to the Smithsonian Institution in 1944.

Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History       Smithsonian Spotlight  Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878)  
The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh.

In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast.

This replica transmitter retains some parts from Frank Conrad’s original, which is credited with the first commercial radio broadcast.

The Cornerstone Podcast
The Cornerstone is a podcast connecting Jewish historical sites in Western Pennsylvania to historic materials in the Rauh Jewish History Program & Archives. Each episode investigates one spot in the region. It might be a synagogue, a schoolhouse, a work of public art, a gravestone, or something as subtle as a painted-over mezuzah. The story of each spot is told through documents, photographs and oral histories, all of which can be studied in greater depth with interactive StoryMaps. The Cornerstone is made possible through a grant from the SteelTree Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.

Our filter systems, which rival hospital-grade systems, capture 99.97% of airborne particulates, well above the level of an N-95 mask, and supply an air change rate (ACR) of 8.5 per hour, or approximately once every seven minutes.
Daily capacity will continue to be monitored to ensure visitor safety.

History of the Rauh Jewish Archives
From 1989 until 1999, the Archives was supported by the United Jewish Federation (currently the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh), in-kind contributions of the Senator John Heinz History Center, and donors. In 1999, Richard E. Rauh created an endowment at the United Jewish Federation Foundation, and the Western Pennsylvania Jewish Archives was renamed the Rauh Jewish Archives (RJA). In 2004, through an agreement between the Jewish Federation Foundation, the RJA Advisory Committee, and the History Center, the RJA has become a program of the History Center, with the income from the RJA Endowment at the Jewish Federation Foundation has been directed to the History Center to support the work of the RJA.

      					The Senator John Heinz History Center is Pennsylvania’s largest history museum and a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives.
				
Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection.
This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs.
Our Story
The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania.
In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years.
Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections.
The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today.
Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District.
With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions.
Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission.
In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage.         Heinz History Center  
As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep.

The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region’s passion for amateur and professional sports.

The Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania’s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh.

In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years.

  African American Program   
African American Collection  
Statements of Solidarity   
      					The African American Program at the Heinz History Center is dedicated to the preservation, dissemination, and interpretation of the life, history, and culture of Africans and African Americans in Western Pennsylvania.
				
This work is accomplished through research, artifact and archival collecting, consulting, educational programming, exhibitions, and public outreach. The emphasis of the African American Collection is to collect historically and culturally significant materials written, owned, generated by, created, used and/or related to African American people, living or deceased.      Advisory Council 
In addition to the institutional operations, the African American Program has a council of dedicated community volunteers that assist with programming and serves as the History Center’s liaison to the African American community of Western Pennsylvania. 
 
The African American Advisory Council is a volunteer group of scholars, educators, artists, executives, entrepreneurs, journalists, politicians, and retirees. The council works with History Center staff as a liaison to the African American community and supports programming, promotes collection development, and assists in the facilitation of various projects.

Collection Donation Form   
      					The Heinz History Center actively seeks collections and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present.
				
If you have objects, photographs, artwork, digital material, or documents that you believe would be of potential interest to our collection, we would like to hear from you. To start the donation process, please tell us about your materials by filling out an Collection Donation Form.
The more information provided about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania, the easier it is for our Collections Committee to assess. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is also appreciated.
Donate to the Collection
For additional questions or information, please email [email protected].      Frequently Asked Questions        
How do I offer historic materials?    
Please use on our online form to offer historic materials.
Please do not bring materials to the History Center without an appointment.
Tell us anything you know about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania. For example, you might explain who owned them and when or how they were used or why they were produced. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is appreciated. The material will then be assessed by our Collections Committee and you will be notified of their decision.    
What is collected?    
Materials that document the lives of Western Pennsylvanians and the history of the region up to and including the present. Historic materials can take many forms, such as personal letters, business records, uniforms, tools, local souvenirs, paintings of Western Pennsylvania, published books or family scrapbooks, hand-made quilts, and Pittsburgh manufactured products. The most important criterion for donation is that the materials say something about this region. It is important to provide as much detail as you can about the articles you wish to donate, this will help the Collections Committee make a more informed decision.    
Are all donations accepted?    
We cannot accept everything. Organizing, cataloging, and preserving historical materials for the future takes so much space, time, and money, that donations must be selected very carefully. Staff review each offer and compare it with what we already have in the collection, they assess its condition and determine what it tells us about life in Western Pennsylvania. Normally, objects and artwork need to be seen before a decision can be made.    
Will my materials be put on display at the History Center?    
Unless we designate your materials for a specific exhibit, they will not be put on display immediately. What you see at the History Center is only a very small part of the collections. That is because we have limited gallery space and because long-term display can have negative effects on preservation. The rest are carefully catalogued and stored in a temperature controlled environment so that they will be available for future exhibits at the History Center, for loan to other museums, or for research and reference for generations to come.    
What should I do to get my donation ready?    
Please do nothing to the items. We prefer to see them in their original condition. Do not clean, repaint, refinish, or “spruce up” historical materials before giving them to us. Please provide as much related historical information as possible. For example, if you plan to offer your grandfather’s report card, you might also offer photographs of him as a student, samples of his school papers and the cap he wore at school. If you have photographs it is helpful to make copies and identify the people and locations in the images.    
How can I see my materials if they are not on display?    
Documents, photographs and published materials are available for research and reference in the Detre Library & Archives at the History Center during regular hours. Requests to see artwork and objects should be made to the collections manager at 412-454-6434. Please give our curators and archivists at least two weeks advance notice.    
Is my donation tax deductible?    
Yes. The donor is responsible for determining and documenting the value of a donation. Staff at the History Center cannot appraise materials. They can give you a list of certified appraisers.    
Can I lend, rather than donate, my historic materials? Or, can my heirs get things back if they are no displayed?    
Materials are not accepted on long term loan, nor can agreements be made to return materials to heirs. Occasionally, short term loans for specific exhibits are accepted. The Deed of Gift, signed by every donor, gives the History Center clear ownership of the materials. The History Center accepts responsibility for preserving each donation for generations to come.    
Can I bequeath materials in my will?    
Yes. Please contact us and let us know of the planned bequest. We appreciate having the opportunity to learn the story behind the materials. We can also explain in further detail the appropriate phrasing for your documents. Please note, bequests must meet collections requirements.    
How is the decision to accept or decline a donation offer made?    
Each item or collection is different, but factors that contribute to the decision include, but are not limited to, its historical or cultural significance to the Western Pennsylvania region, physical condition, whether or not the museum already owns a similar item or copy, and its ownership history.    
How can I tell if the Detre Library & Archives already owns an item?    
With limited space and resources, our interest is in building the collection where gaps exist or in area of particular interest. In general, we are not interested in adding items that duplicate those already in the collection. You can search the Library & Archives holdings here.    
What happens to my collection after it is donated?    
Each item or collection that is donated is assigned a unique number and entered into the online catalog. Depending on the size of a collection, more work might need to be done prior to it being accessible to the public.

Dr. James Adovasio  
Director of Archaeology
 
James M. Adovasio, Ph.D, D.Sc, achieved international acclaim with his archeological excavation of the Meadowcroft Rockshelter beginning in 1973. His work at the Meadowcroft site brought the first serious challenge to the existing paradigm that people had only been on the North American continent for 13,000 years. Evidence from the excavation at Meadowcroft has demonstrated a human presence at the site of at least 19,000 years. The Meadowcroft Rockshelter is known around the world as an important North American archaeological site and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.
 
In addition to his work at Meadowcroft, Dr. Adovasio has excavated at locations around the world and he is recognized as a global authority on perishable materials such as ancient basketry and textiles. He is the author of multiple books including “The First Americans: In Pursuit of Archaeology’s Greatest Mystery” (Random House, 2002), “The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory” (Harper Collins, 2007), and his latest, “Strangers in a New Land” (Firefly Books Ltd., 2016), which documents 35 of the earliest sites in North and South America. He received his B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Arizona, his Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of Utah, and completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution.

Join the History Center and the Veterans Breakfast Club for a storytelling event honoring the strength and sacrifice of women during war time, from the battlefield to the home front.
Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives.
This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences.
The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition, A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime.
Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.
Admission
The program is free with advance registration. Please register in advance online.

About the NRIEP
The University of Pittsburgh’s Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchanges Program’s (NRIEP) mission is sharing stories of regional ethnic communities past and present through inspirational spaces and intercultural experiences.
The Nationality and Heritage Rooms represent the University’s initial commitment to diversity when regional ethnic communities were invited to contribute to cultural representations of their heritages in the rooms. The Nationality and Heritage Rooms are designated as historic landmarks by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation.
The NRIEP also represents the University’s ongoing engagement with the regional community through the Nationality and Heritage Room Committees. The committees provide financial support to Pitt students to undertake global learning experiences in the summer, and they organize intercultural programming on campus that engages Pitt students, faculty, and staff with members of the community across generations.
About The Czechoslovak Room
Donations for the Czechoslovak Nationality Room started to be received in 1925. A permanent Room Committee was formed in 1927. More donations came from local Pittsburgh events such as children’s choir concerts, benefit Symphony Orchestra performances, and soloist performances, along with donations from a committee formed in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak room was dedicated March 7, 1939, on the 89th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, President of Czechoslovakia.

Service Animal Policy
Service animals are always welcome at the Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village.
Dogs are the only animals recognized as service animals by federal and state law. Service animals are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities and must be under control at all times by the owner. Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls. The owner of a service animal may be asked to remove the animal from the premises if they do not take effective action to control the animal.
The Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) definition of service animals. However, animals such as “comfort animals,” “therapy animals,” “companion animals” or “emotional support animals” are not service animals as defined by the ADA, because they are not trained to perform a specific task for an individual with a disability. Therefore, these animals are not permitted entry into our family of museums.
