Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a celebration of restaurants and dining in the steel city. Started in 2012, it’s been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses of celebrating “New Dishes for the New Year” while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare.
What’s Required?
In order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below.
Get Listed: Complete The Online Registration Process Restaurant registration is accepted on a rolling basis up until the celebration. A restaurant must complete the online registration form and submit timely payment to appear on the listing of restaurants and on the participating restaurant map.
The registration form will ask for the anticipated pricing structure (multi-course vs special entrees, but the exact pricing structure is NOT locked in until menu is provided.
On the restaurant listing page, the restaurant appears at the bottom of the page until the menu is received. 
Get Promoted: Submit Menu For Advertising Once the limited-time menu has been determined, upload the special menu through the website to receive the full benefit of the celebration. It is recommended the menu is provided as text-only and not embedded in a prepared graphic. Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant’s profile.
Menus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s social media platforms.
Menus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created. More On Pricing
With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include: Fixed-price 3-course meal for $20.24-45.24.  This variable price point allows restaurants to price their menus’ accordingly. Menu items do not have to come from the restaurant’s regular menu, but should be representative of the restaurant’s style of cooking. As an example, restaurants whose normal ﬁxed price menu is above $35, create a special menu for Restaurant Week for $35.24.
$20.24 Specialty Items in honor of Restaurant Week 2024. This could be a specialty entrée, appetizer-entrée combination or even stretched to “Dinner for Two” depending on the pricing structure that best fits the restaurant.

Step 2: Submit Menu    Each restaurant is expected to create a limited-time, small menu that is offered for dine-in guests between the dates of the celebration. Ideally, this special menu is in addition to the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement.  A multi-course meal – OR – Specialty Dishes priced for the Year
Dinner is the “required” course, but lunch and brunch special menus are also permitted in addition to the dine-in dinner. 
View Past Restaurant Week Profile Pages
After completing the step of submitting the menu, the menu will be formatted and published on your restaurant profile for the season. 
Please DO NOT upload the menu formatted as an image. This will increase the processing time to get it listed onto the site. The graphical menus pictured above will be formatted by PRW and posted on PRW social channels.

Pittsburgh Restaurant Week Summer 2024 • August 12-18
Early Access Weekend: August 9-11
Outdoor Dining • Reservations Recommended Restaurant Week Tips MAKE RESERVATIONS. Most locations accept reservations during restaurant week to streamline their customer service. For restaurants that do not offer online reservations, call to inquire about a dining time. MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK. When being seated and offered menus, ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing.
GRATUITIES APPRECIATED. Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte. If you are able, consider gratuities that take into account the original pricing and extra effort to perfect a multi-course service.  Browse Special Menus Narrow Restaurants & Menus

 food pantry needsA ticket to the South Side Soup Contest—or a fond memory thereof—is more than an afternoon spent tasting soups and exploring businesses. It’s a ticket to lending a helping hand. Each year, a portion of the event’s proceeds goes to the Brashear Association food pantry, which provides vital support to neighbors in need. And while non-perishable food items are essential, your neighbors also need everyday household items like toothpaste, soap, and blankets.The good news is that there are many ways you can help by bringing a nonperishable food or essential household item with you when you check-in.  Donations are welcome at any time during the year! Please call (412) 431-2236 to make arrangements.   food items:Peanut Butter & JellySpaghetti SauceTuna, Salmon (can or pouch) Chicken (can)  CerealSoupsessential household items:ToiletriesCleaning SuppliesPaper SuppliesPlastic bags: quart or gallon size

Our History | South Side Soup Contest   
our historyThe South Side Soup Contest is an annual fundraising event brought to you by the Brashear Association and the South Side Chamber of Commerce. Launched in 2005, The Contest began as a way to showcase all that our community has to offer, generate more foot traffic in local businesses, and serve up delicious soup. Today, it has become a celebrated and eagerly-anticipated event.

We're Green! | South Side Soup Contest   
we're green!We believe that a successful, food-centric event is a green event — one that makes a conscious effort to leave a minimal footprint on the environment. Attendees can be assured that The Contest is 100% green and environmentally-sustainable. Our green philosophy is rooted in what we call the three Soup Contest C’s: commitment, communication, and composting. Here’s how we do it.         CommitmentEach year, we plan and execute The Contest with a shared commitment to the environment. We want our attendees to eat soup and go green!pledgeFrom start to finish, our event is built around environmentally-sustainable practices, which can be seen long after the last spoonful of soup has been enjoyed.partnersEach participating restaurant and host location share our belief in the importance of hosting an environmentally-sound event, and pledge to do their part to keep it green.productsOur commitment is seen in the products we use. From soup cups to utensils, we utilize only compostable products.        CommunicationGoing green is a message we convey with pride. We educate our partners and attendees through a mix of platforms including social media, signs, and images. We also train our volunteer staff to answer questions, so that attendees are in the know when it comes to composting and going green.          compostingAfter every cup of soup has been tasted, votes have been cast, and a happy crowd of returns home, our commitment to going green continues. We partner with AgRecycle, Pennsylvania’s largest source-separated composting operation, to ensure that our compostable waste is recycled into natural materials that enhance soil and encourage plant growth.

EVENT HIGHLIGHTS
International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions.
Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity.
Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves. 
WHO BENEFITS
Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job.
Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness.  
Last year, more than 400 guests sampled fare from more than 20 restaurants showcasing Middle Eastern, Mexican, Turkish, Ethiopian, Thai, and Indian cuisines and more! Once again, our Literacy Pittsburgh staff provided an awesome "City of Bridges" cookie and donut table.                          April 3, 2025

Volunteer tutoring in Pittsburgh
Meet inspiring people with diverse experiences, grow as a person, and make a difference in someone’s life.
I'M READY TO HELP     Volunteering as an adult literacy tutor gives you the chance to see firsthand the impact of your actions. Every day, an average of 200 students are waiting for someone just like you. You don't need to have teaching experience and you don't need to speak a foreign language. Your enthusiasm, patience, and compassion are far more important.
As a Literacy Pittsburgh tutor, you will: Teach an adult reading, writing, and math, or English language skills one-to-one or in a small group.
Attend a free two-part training prior to volunteering
Commit to working with your student for at least 6 months
Teach twice a week for 1.5 to 2 hours each time
Be age 18 or older and possess a high school credential or higher.*
Meet your student at times and in places convenient to both of you**
Receive full support from a staff member assigned to you
Have opportunities for coaching and additional training
Make a difference in someone’s life! I'M READY TO HELP 
If teaching is not a fit for you, there are many other ways you can become a literacy volunteer. You can help a student with completing online job applications, applying for college, or understanding workplace expectations. You can also organize a group of friends or co-workers to help English language learners practice their skills through Classroom Conversation Partners. Or, share your passion for literacy education with friends and family as a fundraising volunteer. Oasis Intergenerational Tutoring and Compass AmeriCorps are also programs to consider as you are looking for volunteering opportunities in Pittsburgh. Learn more. * A copy of the degree or transcript will be required before a tutor can be matched with a student(s).

All sorts of exercises and methods were covered effectively and really allowed me to hit the ground running, even with no prior experience. Additionally, my coordinators have been wonderful, providing excellent advice, suggestions, and guidance along the way. You never feel as if you're alone as a tutor with Literacy Pittsburgh.”

They did a fantastic job of communicating progress and wrapped the program up with a review and recommendations.

Imagine choosing between finishing high school or caring for your sick grandmother. That’s the dilemma Kali had to face. She chose family. When her grandmother passed away, young Kali went to “a very dark place,” she says. She was down but not defeated. When she found out about Literacy Pittsburgh’s high-school equivalency preparation program, she knew she had found a way to move forward. Kali began taking classes at Literacy Pittsburgh's Beaver County branch after her husband returned home from a military assignment and their daughter Layla was born. This past November, Kali passed her GED tests and received her high-school equivalency diploma. That very day she brought cupcakes—and her adorable daughter Layla—to the Literacy Pittsburgh offices to celebrate.

Better lives through learning
Give to a Pittsburgh charity that makes a difference in the lives of adults and families.
GIVE NOW    
How Your Gift Creates Better Lives Through Learning
Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job. Some might give up in the face of these challenges. Not our students. Our students are determined to create a better life for themselves and their children. A better life through learning. Your generous donation today provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It also supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness.  
Ultimately, charitable donations from people like you, help our students to reach their goals. Whether that is to get a job that pays a family-sustaining wage or to earn a GED diploma or to become a U.S. citizen. These accomplishments and so many more are what you make possible when you make a gift to Literacy Pittsburgh.
As a nonprofit organization, we depend on the support of donors like you to fulfill our mission. We know that charitable giving is a big decision. You want to make sure your gift to a non-profit charity is a smart investment in your community. We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our programs, meet our students, read our latest updates, and check out our financial health and program outcomes.
Finally, we always welcome your questions. Feel free to reach out to Tim Richart, Director of Development, at (412) 393-7633 or trichart@literacypittsburgh.org.
Thank you for creating better lives through learning…today and throughout the year.

EVENT HIGHLIGHTS
International Food FairAt the heart of One Big Table is a sprawling international food fair presented by restaurants from our local neighborhoods, where chefs, culinary artists, and food enthusiasts come together to prepare and present a world-class selection of global cuisines from local restaurants. Many of the featured restaurants are immigrant-owned. Attendees can embark on a culinary journey, savoring dishes from every corner of the world, spicy Thai curries, flavorful Mexican empanadas, delicate French pastries, flaky Indian samosas, and so much more. The food fair offers a unique opportunity to taste, learn, and appreciate different culinary traditions.
Entertainment ExtravaganzaThe event is a feast not just for the palate but for all the senses, featuring an array of live performances that represent diverse cultures and talents from across the globe. Attendees can expect to be mesmerized by traditional dances, live music, and much more. Each performance adds to the vibrancy of the event, creating a unique atmosphere of celebration and unity.
Global MarketplaceFor those looking to take a piece of the world home, a global marketplace features unique products, souvenirs, and international handicrafts. It's a great opportunity to shop for one-of-a-kind items from around the globe. Some of the artists selected to participate may have benefited from Literacy Pittsburgh programming themselves. 
WHO BENEFITS
Education opens doors. Unfortunately, too many people in our region missed out on the opportunity to complete their education due to family, personal, or learning challenges. We also have many families immigrating to the Pittsburgh area who may know a little English, but not enough to converse with native speakers or get a decent-paying job.
Proceeds from One Big Table provides our students with caring, experienced professional teachers and trained volunteer tutors. It provides books and materials, technology, and innovative programs that move students from learning to earning. It supports infrastructure that gives our students a safe and comfortable learning environment and a staff committed to both efficiency and effectiveness.  
Last year, more than 400 guests sampled fare from more than 20 restaurants showcasing Middle Eastern, Mexican, Turkish, Ethiopian, Thai, and Indian cuisines and more! Once again, our Literacy Pittsburgh staff provided an awesome "City of Bridges" cookie and donut table.                          April 3, 2025

Best food festival in Pittsburgh – VOTED 2 years in a row! For the most up to date information and details check us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.      Why start a VegFest in Pittsburgh?
The ‘story’  behind the party!
The founders of Justice for Animals (JFA), Leila and Natalie, met at a protest against the animal cruelty found in circuses and became instant friends. After creating JFA, they organized VegFest to bring the community together and extend compassion to more than just dogs and cats.
Leila – after working professionally in animal rights and attending and tabling other VegFests across the country and Natalie –  who saw the vision for a VegFest in the city of Pittsburgh, together saw the need for a fun outdoor festival-type celebration to bring attention to important issues in a family friendly and positive way.
They decided to to this by supporting the local community and inviting vendors from Pittsburgh’s small businesses, top-notch veg food establishments, and animal welfare organizations. Bringing together aspects of sustainable living, such as yoga, and live music to round out the fun festival atmosphere, VegFest 2015 was received beyond expectations–bringing out nearly 5,000 Pittsburghers!
The overwhelming response of Pittsburgh embracing VegFest solidified its need in Pittsburgh for with a mission to make each year bigger and better!
  About Natalie Compassion and empathy toward animals started at a young age for Natalie, as she always felt a deep connection with “the little guy.”
She always rooted for the “black sheep” because she often felt like an outcast as a child. Due to their defenselessness and vulnerability, animals fit that underdog mold, and thus they have always held a special place in her heart.
As an adult, Natalie became a vegetarian. She refused to bring harm to animals as a means to satisfy her own hunger.
In 2010, Natalie began volunteering at PETA. Within three years, she was conducting undercover investigations to document animal cruelty in zoos and circuses.
One of those investigations resulted in fines and citations levied by the USDA against one of the largest circus and exotic animal acts in the United States. 
About Leila From a young age, Leila refused to eat any food produced as a result of an animal’s death.
She not only disliked the taste of meat, but she also questioned why people felt the need to eat it as a means of survival.
A longtime protester of human rights, Leila became very passionate about animal rights. In 2005, she began interning at PETA.
Several years later, she started working for PETA professionally. She toured the country, spreading awareness for the plight of animals being used for food, clothing, experiments, and entertainment.
In fact, she’s been on the front lines for hundreds of demonstrations against animal cruelty throughout the United States.
Over the years, Leila has worked and presented at VegFests across the county, promoting vegan diets and awareness of animal mistreatment.

Big Day Entertainment
Little Italy Days started in 2002 to celebrate Bloomfield’s Italian heritage, and create a destination spot for Italian-themed entertainment and food. The event has grown through the years and is now lasts four days.
Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has mooved to August. “I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather”
“I am excited and honored to produce this community oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved.”
Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors – Highmark & Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor – Rohrich Shadyside Honda. Additional Sponsors include UPMC Shadyside, Children’s Hospital of UPMC, PNC Bank, First National Bank, Mascaro, Pittsburgh Brewing Co. First Commonwealth Bank and Froggy’s.

Big Day Entertainment
Little Italy Days started in 2002 to celebrate Bloomfield’s Italian heritage, and create a destination spot for Italian-themed entertainment and food. The event has grown through the years and is now lasts four days.
Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has mooved to August. “I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather”
“I am excited and honored to produce this community oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved.”
Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors – Highmark & Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor – Rohrich Shadyside Honda. Additional Sponsors include UPMC Shadyside, Children’s Hospital of UPMC, PNC Bank, First National Bank, Mascaro, Pittsburgh Brewing Co. First Commonwealth Bank and Froggy’s.

The Pittsburgh Vegan Expo & the ORIGINAL Pittsburgh Vegan Festival is the city’s oldest and longest-running vegan festival.

The Pittsburgh Vegan Expo & the ORIGINAL Pittsburgh Vegan Festival is the city’s oldest and longest-running vegan festival. It was established in the 90’s by Amy “Amethyst” Cottrill, who has spent all these years building up something the city really needed! We are proud to say we are the city’s original. 
This event has taken place all over the city, and has moved to its current location at Monroeville Convention Center. 
We also hold monthly vegan events in various locations around the city and beyond. See the Other Events section for details. 
Our events support food and other businesses, artists, entertainers, healing arts & wellness, and environmentalism (such as our RE-Model Gala: a reuse-themed dance fashion show and wearable art contest), as well as many animal sanctuaries and other non-profit organizations.   Past Guest Speakers
Our festival has featured many prominent speakers, such as Dr. Neal Barnard of Pcrm.org; Dean Caliguire (former Pittsburgh Steeler, Pitt Panther and San Francisco 49er); Khama Worthy (UFC fighter) and more.

About Us  Leave this field empty if you're human:        Pittsburgh Vegan Expo & Convention is the city’s original, largest and longest-running vegan event! Food, entertainment, speakers, films, kids’ room, more!
Pittsburgh Vegan Festival is an on-going event series hosted by Amethyst.  She has been organizing vegan events from the age of 16, and first transitioned from vegetarianism to vegan, as soon as she found out what veganism meant.
With the recent, more wide-spread awareness among more and more people, about how veganism positively effects the environment, health, and the treatment of animals, and how great vegan food and products really are these days, Amethyst’s small vegan events had a sudden need to turn into festivals, to accommodate the huge amount of people who have an interest in veganism!

    About VegFest  What is a VegFest? This FREE admission event is hosted by the non-profit organization Justice For Animals
VegFest has grown to over 8,000-10,000 in attendance annually by offering activities like cooking and food demonstrations, yoga and kids activities
PLUS live music, shopping, and informative speakers that are sure to keep everyone entertained all day!
Small business merchandise and wellness vendors, non-profit animal welfare organizations, and adoptions, along with the city’s BEST veg food will be spread out across Allegheny Park.
Best food festival in Pittsburgh – VOTED 2 years in a row! For the most up to date information and details check us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.      Why start a VegFest in Pittsburgh?
The ‘story’  behind the party!
The founders of Justice for Animals (JFA), Leila and Natalie, met at a protest against the animal cruelty found in circuses and became instant friends. After creating JFA, they organized VegFest to bring the community together and extend compassion to more than just dogs and cats.
Leila – after working professionally in animal rights and attending and tabling other VegFests across the country and Natalie –  who saw the vision for a VegFest in the city of Pittsburgh, together saw the need for a fun outdoor festival-type celebration to bring attention to important issues in a family friendly and positive way.
They decided to to this by supporting the local community and inviting vendors from Pittsburgh’s small businesses, top-notch veg food establishments, and animal welfare organizations. Bringing together aspects of sustainable living, such as yoga, and live music to round out the fun festival atmosphere, VegFest 2015 was received beyond expectations–bringing out nearly 5,000 Pittsburghers!
The overwhelming response of Pittsburgh embracing VegFest solidified its need in Pittsburgh for with a mission to make each year bigger and better!
  About Natalie Compassion and empathy toward animals started at a young age for Natalie, as she always felt a deep connection with “the little guy.”
She always rooted for the “black sheep” because she often felt like an outcast as a child. Due to their defenselessness and vulnerability, animals fit that underdog mold, and thus they have always held a special place in her heart.
As an adult, Natalie became a vegetarian. She refused to bring harm to animals as a means to satisfy her own hunger.
In 2010, Natalie began volunteering at PETA. Within three years, she was conducting undercover investigations to document animal cruelty in zoos and circuses.
One of those investigations resulted in fines and citations levied by the USDA against one of the largest circus and exotic animal acts in the United States. 
About Leila From a young age, Leila refused to eat any food produced as a result of an animal’s death.
She not only disliked the taste of meat, but she also questioned why people felt the need to eat it as a means of survival.
A longtime protester of human rights, Leila became very passionate about animal rights. In 2005, she began interning at PETA.
Several years later, she started working for PETA professionally. She toured the country, spreading awareness for the plight of animals being used for food, clothing, experiments, and entertainment.
In fact, she’s been on the front lines for hundreds of demonstrations against animal cruelty throughout the United States.
Over the years, Leila has worked and presented at VegFests across the county, promoting vegan diets and awareness of animal mistreatment.

Mark your calendars because the Cookie Tour is happening on Saturday, December 9th, and Sunday, December 10th, from 12 pm to 5 pm. That’s two whole days of scrumptious adventure waiting for you!   
For an amazing twenty-six years, we’ve been ringing in the holiday season by inviting folks to join us in Lawrenceville’s business district to do their holiday shopping, meet our local business owners and snack on all kinds of homemade cookies. The Cookie Tour has grown into an absolute sensation, becoming one of the largest and most sought-after holiday events in the entire region. Not only is it a festive extravaganza, but it’s also a lifeline for our cherished small businesses.   
As we get closer to the event, we’ll publish a map that showcases all the amazing businesses participating. Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!     We are also bringing back the Cookie Tour Cup – which business has the best cookie?! You get to decide. A trophy will go to the people’s choice for best cookie of the tour.

Wishing Mister Rogers a happy birthday!   Today, we celebrate the legacy of kindness and empathy he left behind. Did you know that at Arsenal Family and Children Center in Lawrenceville, Mister Rogers and Dr. McFarland provided preschool education and gathered insights from children to enrich his show? It's where Ryan Scarola, Operations Manager, got his start.  Here's to continuing Mister Rogers' mission of spreading love and understanding!

Whether it's by shopping local, sharing their stories, or simply stopping by to say hello, every little action counts. Here's to the women leading the way in Lawrenceville and beyond!

We were happy to host URA Pittsburgh for a Business District Quarterly Networking Meeting here at the Ice House Studios! We enjoyed delicious food from Mi Empanada, a presentation from PRLA Career Opportunities about their restaurant apprenticeship program, and an introduction to Shiftworks Community + Public Arts. It was a great networking and informational opportunity.

Cookie Tour 2023Home » Cookie Tour 2023               SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9 AND SUNDAY, DECEMBER 10
12PM-5PM     
Mark your calendars because the Cookie Tour is happening on Saturday, December 9th, and Sunday, December 10th, from 12 pm to 5 pm. That’s two whole days of scrumptious adventure waiting for you!   
For an amazing twenty-six years, we’ve been ringing in the holiday season by inviting folks to join us in Lawrenceville’s business district to do their holiday shopping, meet our local business owners and snack on all kinds of homemade cookies. The Cookie Tour has grown into an absolute sensation, becoming one of the largest and most sought-after holiday events in the entire region. Not only is it a festive extravaganza, but it’s also a lifeline for our cherished small businesses.   
As we get closer to the event, we’ll publish a map that showcases all the amazing businesses participating. Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!     We are also bringing back the Cookie Tour Cup – which business has the best cookie?! You get to decide. A trophy will go to the people’s choice for best cookie of the tour.

Outdoor Dining & Retail in the Right-Of-Way   Outdoor Dining & Retail License
Outdoor Dining & Retail License applications can now be found on OneStopPGH.
Applicant Guidance can be found here.  A business owner must apply for an Outdoor Dining & Retail License to use the public right- of-way (the sidewalk or parking lane) for their business operations. The fee for an Outdoor Dining & Retail License is $150.      What is the Outdoor Dining & Retail License?
On February 17, 2022, Mayor Ed Gainey signed Ordinance 2022-0073, which creates new standards for Outdoor Retail and Dining in the City of Pittsburgh. This change comes after The City streamlined its review process of outdoor dining and retail to accommodate COVID-19 safety measures under the emergency declaration, in order to support our business community, especially restaurants, during trying economic times.
These new standards guidelines give authority to the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), through the issuance of licenses, to permits the use of portion(s) of the public right-of-way for food and retail services. The new Outdoor Dining and Retail License streamlines regulations, standards, and procedures for outdoor dining or retail activities to better serve our business community while also putting into place new expectations for license holders to maintain accessibility, appearance, safety and maintenance a part of the privilege for the use of public space.
This guidance applies to the public ROW under the stewardship of DOMI. It does not extend to any public lot, park, other public property, or private property. Other approvals from the City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI), Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB), or others may still be required. Other permits and licenses referenced in this document are not comprehensive.
Applications for retail display with four (4) seats or fewer under this subsection shall be exempt from site plan requirements of this chapter as long as they can demonstrate that they meet all requirements in Placement and Design Requirements for Use of Sidewalk in § 425.03.

Community PlanningHome » ABOUT » Community Planning         
 In partnership with Lawrenceville United and countless community members, the Lawrenceville Corporation has participated in the creation of numerous community plans. Each plan has been informed by robust and inclusive community engagement processes, community partners and stakeholders, and studies of existing conditions and best practices.
Community plans are visions of Lawrenceville’s future. These visions can define our strengths and values, pinpoint places the community would like to see change and grow, and steer development toward a desired future.     
Opportunities for Input
         
LC and LU Joint Strategic Plan 2023
Despite having existing shared goals, objectives, work plans, and community plans for Lawrenceville over the years, the organizations have never developed a joint strategic plan. In previous strategic plans that the organizations have completed, there has always been an outstanding question or task left related to how LC and LU pursue a future together, and that question has become all the more pressing as the organizations have grown more aligned related to mission, vision, values, and priorities in response to the changes underway in Lawrenceville.  
Learn More         
Clack Campus Community Process
Created in partnership with Lawrenceville United in 2021, the Clack Campus Development Guidelines are a vision for the future redevelopment of Allegheny County’s Frank B. Clack Health Center at 4401 Penn Avenue.  
Learn More         
Green Boulevard Plan
A vision that reimagined riverfront access, land use, transportation, and open space along the south shore of the Allegheny River. The plan has been used to guide riverfront development since it was first conceived in 2010.  In Summer 2023, the city constructed the first leg of the recommended shared use bike-pedestrian commuter path.  
Learn More         
Arsenal Park Master Plan
A plan originally created in 2015 to balance and protect Arsenal Park’s rich history with new and restored amenities to support contemporary community life. The plan is now undergoing a city-led update before final implementation.  
Get Involved         
Leslie Park Master Plan
Drawing on Leslie Park’s historical design, the 2015 plan provides a framework to establish the park as a neighborhood resource for recreation, performance, and exhibition. The Plan will be undergoing a city-led update in 2023.          
Completed Community Plans
Once a community plan is completed, it is time for advocacy, fundraising, and implementation. Lawrenceville Corporation and Lawrenceville United worked together to map out how community plans will guide the projects and programs of our organizations from 2019 to 2026, visualized in the Lawrenceville Community Plan and Guidebook. Continue reading to learn more about the individual plans.
Neighborhood and Corridor Wide Plans
Upper Lawrenceville Plan (2013): Identified three strengths to build upon- Affordability and authenticity (live), space for people to make and grow things (work), and abundant recreational amenities, from neighborhood parks to the riverfront (play). McCandless Street is identified as the spine of Upper Lawrenceville, as a major conduit to the riverfront and the planned “McCandless Beach,” a connector in a network of planned green streets, and the center of business district activity at its Butler Street intersection. The plan also recommends reinvigorating existing parks with new physical or programmatic connections.
Green Boulevard Plan (2010) A vision that reimagined riverfront access, land use, transportation, and open space along the south shore of the Allegheny River. The plan has been used to guide riverfront development since it was first conceived in 2010.  In Fall 2022, the city will construct the first leg of the recommended shared use bike-pedestrian commuter path.
East End Market-Based Development Strategy (2012): An effort to coordinate activities and functions between six neighborhood organizations along the corridor – Lawrenceville Corporation, and Lawrenceville United, Bloomfield Development Corporation, Bloomfield- Garfield Corporation, Friendship Development Associates, and East Liberty Development Inc.
Lower Lawrenceville (LOLA) Plan (2009): The result of an eight-month planning process building upon the Lawrenceville Community Plan and the Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan. Focused on Butler Street, Doughboy Square, and the Riverfront and recommended increased density and infill development; streetscape improvements; greening with street trees, neighborhood parks, and riverfront connections; public art and marketing; improved connectivity; and integrated parking and mobility planning.
Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan (2008): An urban design plan and commercial/residential market analysis for the Penn Avenue Corridor from 34th Street to Euclid Avenue. Recommendations included establishing gateways at Doughboy Square, 40th + Penn, and Main + Penn; creating an integrated mobility plan and implementing streetscape improvements; establishing higher density office or residential redevelopment between 39th and Fisk Streets; and the expansion of Arsenal Park.
Mobility
Butler Street Design Guidelines (2019): An explicit set of conditions-based block-by block standards for streetscape components to ensure that future development projects foster a safe, accessible, and beautiful Butler Street for all, regardless of the mode of transportation. Encompass the length of Butler Street and make recommendations for the design, materials, fabrication, installation, and maintenance for the following streetscape elements: ADA accessible walkways, sidewalks, street trees, public art, street lighting, stormwater management, street furniture, way-finding signage, cycling and public transportation amenities, and other elements as appropriate.
2015 Updated Parking Study (2015): An update to the 2012 parking study, this study sought to understand the current parking conditions in Lawrenceville and identify potential parking opportunities and improvements. Found that bike parking and on-street car parking along Butler had b0th increased since 2012. However, this supply growth was outpaced by a growth in parking demand, which was especially high from 37th to 45th Street. Recommended encouraging other modes of transportation, facilitating shared parking agreements, and creating additional opportunities for off-street parking.
Penn Avenue Streetscape Program (2009): Building off of the Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan, this streetscape program develops a palette of recommended sidewalk, transit, pole, and place-making elements along Penn Avenue. Lawrenceville-specific recommendations are highlighted for Doughboy Square, the Penn-Main intersection, and the residential area in between.
Environment
Leslie Park Master Plan (2015): Provides a framework to establish Leslie Park as a neighborhood resource for recreation, performance, and exhibition. The Plan will be undergoing a city-led update in 2023.
Arsenal Park Master Plan (2014): A plan to balance and protect Arsenal Park’s rich history with new and restored amenities to support contemporary community life. The plan is now undergoing a city-led update before final implementation.
Releaf Lawrenceville (2014): With a tree canopy cover of nearly half of the city-wide average, this plan was developed to increase and improve Lawrenceville’s tree canopy cover. It recommends programs targeted at homeowners, industrial property owners, commercial property owners, cemeteries, and community spaces.
Historic Preservation
Lawrenceville Residential Design Guidelines (2013): Created to assist homeowners with façade restoration, these guidelines help to preserve, enhance and celebrate the historical integrity of Lawrenceville’s architectural heritage.
The Archives
Who Moves to Lawrenceville and Why? (2012): A study that interrogated the reasons why people moved to or from Lawrenceville meant to provide community leaders with an understanding of the factors driving recent change in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood.
3400 Doughboy Square Urban Design Program (2012): Initiated by Lawrenceville Corporation, this was an urban design study to develop building recommendations for the site located at 3400 Penn Avenue in Doughboy Square. Building from this study, Lawrenceville Corporation brought on Action Housing to develop the site as affordable housing. The Sixth Ward Flats is the result of this partnership, completed in 2021. Read more about the Sixth Ward Flats here.
Lawrenceville Community Plan (2006): A comprehensive plan of the three Lawrenceville neighborhoods, led by Lawrenceville Corporation, Lawrenceville United, and the Lawrenceville Stakeholders.

Mobility Enhancement DistrictHome » COMMUNITY » Mobility Enhancement District            Starting November 1, 2024 the Mobility Enhancement District goes into effect.
This program will better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville while funding much needed mobility and infrastructure improvements.
*There will be a grace period from November 1st through November 14th*      
Why the changes?
Metered parking allows for better access to spots along our busy neighborhood streets leading to a higher rate of turnover for local businesses. The collected revenue goes into a dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville.
The community will meet annually to decide how the funds will be used.
Some possible options for the funds would be to implement sidewalk improvements, build bus shelters, add bike paths, or YOUR IDEA to help support the mobility and access to our community.   Curious how we got to this decision? 
Read below for a breakdown of past communications, community meetings, and information. If you have any additional questions, please reach out!   Visit our FAQ page about this process!   Mobility Enhancement District Implementation Phase   What is a Mobility Enhancement District?
The Mobility Enhancement District is legislation written by Councilwoman Deb Gross that aims to better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville, while funding much-needed mobility and infrastructure improvements to make Lawrenceville safer, more accessible, and easier to get around for all community members, while increasing foot traffic that our small business community depends on.
A dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville, which would come from:  New meters along Butler Street 
Nighttime enforcement of meters
Dynamic pricing that would capture extra revenue when demand is at its peak
This is a 1 year pilot   
We want your Feedback   
Read More and ask Questions of City Staff on the Lawrenceville Mobility Enhancement Engage Page
Read the meeting recap
Fill out the LC/LU Feedback Form   
Our Engagement in 2023   April 13th, 6:30PM at Arsenal Middle School: Kickoff Community Meeting (recap here)
April 18th, 5pm-7pm at Trace Brewing: Open House #1
April 29th, 11am-2pm at Ice House Studios: Open House #2
May 1st, 11am-2pm at Boys and Girls Club: Open House #3
May 11th, 6:30pm at Goodwill: Closing Community Meeting   
What are the goals of this process?    Create positive, community-determined mobility enhancements to our neighborhood streets to benefit the community members and our visitors, including: sidewalk repair, bus shelters, parking solutions, etc. 
Improve our public infrastructure 
Manage parking demand more effectively     
What is a Mobility Enhancement District (MED)?   The Mobility Enhancement District is an ordinance written by Councilwoman Deb Gross that aims to better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville, while funding much-needed mobility and infrastructure improvements to make Lawrenceville safer, more accessible, and easier to get around for all community members, while increasing foot traffic that our small business community depends on.
Quick notes:
-Legislation (read here) has been introduced by Councilwoman Gross and is sitting in committee
-This would create a dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville, which would come from:  New meters along Butler Street and Penn Avenue
Nighttime enforcement of meters
Dynamic pricing that would capture extra revenue when demand is at its peak
Potential uses of MED based off of Butler Street Design Guidelines Plan (est. 2019): Bus shelters
Sidewalk repairs
Bike infrastructure
Traffic Calming
Give us your feedback!  Note: Revenue for the fund would NOT come from enforcement (ticketing).   Examples:               
                        
Map of Proposed Mobility Enhancement District       What is Residential Permit Parking (RPP)?   A program that gives residents of a designated area a better chance to park near their home. A permit costs $20 per vehicle, per program year. People without the permit are allowed to park in the designated RPP areas for one hour before being subject to a ticket.
Key questions we want community input on: Is there demand for new RPP areas on residential blocks that are experiencing high parking demand and don’t currently require permits?
Are changes necessary to hours of enforcement to better manage parking demand in the evening? (for example, would noon to midnight be better enforcement hours in RPP areas instead of 7 AM to 7 PM?)
Is there interest in hybrid zones (an RPP area that would additionally allow for non-residents to pay for parking at a meter)?           
   
                What are Some Residential Permit Parking Options (RPP)?   To get community members thinking about the questions listed in the previous section, we are sharing three options for how different versions of RPP and Hybrid RPP areas might be configured. THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY OPTIONS. These options are not proposals that we’re trying to advance, so much as three different ideas to consider while we invite your feedback on possible RPP changes and while we try to determine where consensus may exist in the community.
Option A – Status Quo – Keep RPP how it currently is in Lawrenceville
Option B – Add RPP and Hybrid Zones
Option C – All RPP with Meters   
RPP Reconfiguration Examples

Neighborhood Metrics
Over the past several years, Lawrenceville Corporation has helped create a Lawrenceville community of growing opportunities. Our neighborhood has changed dramatically as a result, and so too has our charge as an organization. As we continue efforts to better serve the Lawrenceville that exists today, we must begin by honoring and understanding our neighborhood’s past and everything that has happened to get us here. 
To this end, Lawrenceville Corporation began an effort in 2021 to understand and document neighborhood change, an effort which culminated in the Lawrenceville Neighborhood Metrics Report. The report brings together information from census and municipal data, expertise from contacts across the city, and insights from our own programs and research. In some instances, it reveals truths hidden beneath the surface. In others, it reflects and affirms the lived experience of our community members, serving to quantify and contextualize these observations. 
Information is an invaluable resource, and it is the goal of this project to share it with the broader community, with this webpage as the central hub. Read the full report now, or continue below for the highlights.

Housing uses a variety of sources to investigate housing composition, rising costs, the loss of subsidized housing availability, and new affordable housing developments.
Neighborhood Wellness summarizes information related to public safety and food security.                                                  Economic Vibrancy  The second part of the report, Economic Vibrancy, is broken into two sections: Lawrenceville’s Main Street Corridors is the result of a business district-wide survey led by LC staff in March 2022. Through this effort, we collected information including occupancy, condition of storefront, and type of business, among others.
Economic Development and Investment is the result of an analysis of building permits, real estate sales, and ownership, as well as a review of development projects brought through the community process in recent years.                                         Land Use & Environment  Part three of the report, Land Use and Environment, explores the following: Land Use includes current zoning and land use data.
Mobility includes car ownership and commuting data from the 2020 Census, ridership data from POGOH Bikeshare, Pittsburgh Regional Transit, and Spin Scooters, among other data.
Environment includes everything from tree canopy cover and green space to energy use and air quality.

About Ice House StudiosHome » About Ice House Studios      
History
In June 2001, the Ice House Artist Studios at 100 43rd Street in Lawrenceville opened its doors as a new facility for 32 artists, arts-related businesses and arts organizations. The project was enthusiastically supported by the Lawrenceville community for its re-use of a long-abandoned, historic building and its attraction of artists and new businesses to the neighborhood. The National Park Service granted historic status late in 2000 by listing the property on the National Register of Historic Places.
The 35,000 sq. ft. ice house building was originally constructed in 1907 by the Consolidated Ice Company and operated as an ice making facility until the early 50s. The property was used only sporadically over the second half of the century and was a tremendous eyesore in the community with its boarded-up windows and generally run­ down condition.
Artists and Cities secured an option on the property in May 1999. Working with Perkins Eastman Architects and Sota Construction Services, construction began in October, 2000 and was completed by the end of May, 2001. Our design increased the building floor plan from 35,000 sq. ft. to 44,000 sq. ft. and provided for 32 spaces ranging in size from 427 sq. ft. to 2,500 sq. ft.     
Today
Ice House Studios continues to offer affordable studio spaces for artists and makers. It is currently owned by Ice Factory Limited Partnership and is managed by Lawrenceville Corporation. It is home to 30 artists and organizations.
Amenities include: Fully private workspaces range in size from 400 sqft to 2,500 sqft.

Governance, Nominating     
Organizational Committees   
Our work is guided by our Board of Directors in addition to advisory committees that inform the work of the Board of Directors and the Staff of the organization:     
Board of Directors
Composed of all elected Board Members the board steers the organization towards a sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical, and legal governance and financial management policies, as well as making sure the organization has adequate resources to advance its mission, hiring, and managing of the Executive Director.
Executive Committee
Composed of the President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary, the Executive Committee has the power and authority to transact LC’s regular business in the intervals between meetings of the Board. We reported all actions at the next regular meeting. The Executive Committee annually reviews the Executive Director and also oversees the Board’s work related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  
Finance Committee
Comprised of the Treasurer and no less than two other Board Members, in addition to other LC Members. The Finance Committee monitors the financial activities of LC and serves as a liaison with LC’s outside auditors.
Business District Advisory Committee
Composed of Lawrenceville businesses and their employees. This Committee works to inform the work of LC that is focused on supporting small businesses, marketing and promotional events, and other programming related to the business community.      Community Development Committee
The Community Development Committee reviews and informs community plans and development projects. This committee advises staff and LC’s Board on positions to take related to development-related programming, projects, and planning processes
Nominating Committee
Supports the Board of Directors in fulfilling its fiduciary duties to recruit and appoint the best-qualified candidates for the Board of Directors and Board Officer positions to a slate that is brought to Membership for approval.
Governance Committee
Responsible for reviewing the governance structures, practices of the organization, report its findings, and making recommendations to the Board. The Governance Committee evaluates the performance of the existing Board in addition to organizational committees. This Committee also reviews and works with the Board to update LC’s mission, vision, values of the organization, and its governing documents (the articles of incorporation, bylaws, conflict of interest policy). The Committee works closely with the Nominating Committee to monitor the Board Nominations and Elections Process.
Asset Management Committee
The Asset Management Committee guides and informs LC’s real estate strategy, programming for common spaces, capital improvements, and general maintenance work related to LC – owned properties such as the Ice House and Blackbird Studios. It also guides decisions related to the financial performance of its properties and financing capital improvements.

Cookie Tour 2023Home » Cookie Tour 2023               SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9 AND SUNDAY, DECEMBER 10
12PM-5PM     
Mark your calendars because the Cookie Tour is happening on Saturday, December 9th, and Sunday, December 10th, from 12 pm to 5 pm. That’s two whole days of scrumptious adventure waiting for you!   
For an amazing twenty-six years, we’ve been ringing in the holiday season by inviting folks to join us in Lawrenceville’s business district to do their holiday shopping, meet our local business owners and snack on all kinds of homemade cookies. The Cookie Tour has grown into an absolute sensation, becoming one of the largest and most sought-after holiday events in the entire region. Not only is it a festive extravaganza, but it’s also a lifeline for our cherished small businesses.   
As we get closer to the event, we’ll publish a map that showcases all the amazing businesses participating. Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!     We are also bringing back the Cookie Tour Cup – which business has the best cookie?! You get to decide. A trophy will go to the people’s choice for best cookie of the tour.
Special thank you to our Cookie Cup Trophy Sponsor – Pittsburgh Trophy Co.

  Welcome to Lawrenceville’s 2nd PRIDE
Calling all LGBTQIA+, allied businesses, and creatives in Lawrenceville! Brace yourselves for the ultimate pride celebration on Saturday June 15th, 2024. This day will feature a series of events and opportunities throughout Lawrenceville, as local businesses show their pride, love, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community.
Lawrenceville is a place where creative people and ideas meet, and lifelong friendships and memories are made.  A community built strong with residents, visitors, and business owners. What better neighborhood than Lawrenceville to celebrate our LGBTQIA+ community with a neighborhood-wide pride event?
Lawrenceville Pride is designed to offer opportunity for the community to support local small businesses that continually provide essential resources to our queer neighbors. An inclusive event that cultivates equality, selflessness, and love.
Queer and allied business owners in Lawrenceville strive to create a safe and comforting environment resulting in a more impactful event each year. As the community continues to grow, our hope is to make LV Pride as effective as possible in providing a cherished experience for the community.
An exciting addition this year’s Lawrenceville Pride is the Pride Kick-Off event at Iron City Boulders on Friday, June 14th. Jump start your Lawrenceville Pride Weekend with an after-hours drag show starting at 10PM.
Join the celebration on June 15th from 12-5pm for food, fun, beer, and friends. As a community built on solidarity and trust, Lawrenceville is committed to protecting and supporting our neighbors beyond this event and the month of June and we need YOU to do the same.

Outdoor Dining & Retail in the Right-Of-Way   Outdoor Dining & Retail License
Outdoor Dining & Retail License applications can now be found on OneStopPGH.
Applicant Guidance can be found here.  A business owner must apply for an Outdoor Dining & Retail License to use the public right- of-way (the sidewalk or parking lane) for their business operations. The fee for an Outdoor Dining & Retail License is $150.      What is the Outdoor Dining & Retail License?
On February 17, 2022, Mayor Ed Gainey signed Ordinance 2022-0073, which creates new standards for Outdoor Retail and Dining in the City of Pittsburgh. This change comes after The City streamlined its review process of outdoor dining and retail to accommodate COVID-19 safety measures under the emergency declaration, in order to support our business community, especially restaurants, during trying economic times.
These new standards guidelines give authority to the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), through the issuance of licenses, to permits the use of portion(s) of the public right-of-way for food and retail services. The new Outdoor Dining and Retail License streamlines regulations, standards, and procedures for outdoor dining or retail activities to better serve our business community while also putting into place new expectations for license holders to maintain accessibility, appearance, safety and maintenance a part of the privilege for the use of public space.
This guidance applies to the public ROW under the stewardship of DOMI. It does not extend to any public lot, park, other public property, or private property. Other approvals from the City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI), Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB), or others may still be required. Other permits and licenses referenced in this document are not comprehensive.
Applications for retail display with four (4) seats or fewer under this subsection shall be exempt from site plan requirements of this chapter as long as they can demonstrate that they meet all requirements in Placement and Design Requirements for Use of Sidewalk in § 425.03.

Community PlanningHome » ABOUT » Community Planning         
 In partnership with Lawrenceville United and countless community members, the Lawrenceville Corporation has participated in the creation of numerous community plans. Each plan has been informed by robust and inclusive community engagement processes, community partners and stakeholders, and studies of existing conditions and best practices.
Community plans are visions of Lawrenceville’s future. These visions can define our strengths and values, pinpoint places the community would like to see change and grow, and steer development toward a desired future.     
Opportunities for Input
         
LC and LU Joint Strategic Plan 2023
Despite having existing shared goals, objectives, work plans, and community plans for Lawrenceville over the years, the organizations have never developed a joint strategic plan. In previous strategic plans that the organizations have completed, there has always been an outstanding question or task left related to how LC and LU pursue a future together, and that question has become all the more pressing as the organizations have grown more aligned related to mission, vision, values, and priorities in response to the changes underway in Lawrenceville.

Clack Campus Community Process
Created in partnership with Lawrenceville United in 2021, the Clack Campus Development Guidelines are a vision for the future redevelopment of Allegheny County’s Frank B. Clack Health Center at 4401 Penn Avenue.  
Learn More         
Green Boulevard Plan
A vision that reimagined riverfront access, land use, transportation, and open space along the south shore of the Allegheny River. The plan has been used to guide riverfront development since it was first conceived in 2010.  In Summer 2023, the city constructed the first leg of the recommended shared use bike-pedestrian commuter path.  
Learn More         
Arsenal Park Master Plan
A plan originally created in 2015 to balance and protect Arsenal Park’s rich history with new and restored amenities to support contemporary community life. The plan is now undergoing a city-led update before final implementation.  
Get Involved         
Leslie Park Master Plan
Drawing on Leslie Park’s historical design, the 2015 plan provides a framework to establish the park as a neighborhood resource for recreation, performance, and exhibition. The Plan will be undergoing a city-led update in 2023.          
Completed Community Plans
Once a community plan is completed, it is time for advocacy, fundraising, and implementation. Lawrenceville Corporation and Lawrenceville United worked together to map out how community plans will guide the projects and programs of our organizations from 2019 to 2026, visualized in the Lawrenceville Community Plan and Guidebook. Continue reading to learn more about the individual plans.
Neighborhood and Corridor Wide Plans
Upper Lawrenceville Plan (2013): Identified three strengths to build upon- Affordability and authenticity (live), space for people to make and grow things (work), and abundant recreational amenities, from neighborhood parks to the riverfront (play). McCandless Street is identified as the spine of Upper Lawrenceville, as a major conduit to the riverfront and the planned “McCandless Beach,” a connector in a network of planned green streets, and the center of business district activity at its Butler Street intersection. The plan also recommends reinvigorating existing parks with new physical or programmatic connections.
Green Boulevard Plan (2010) A vision that reimagined riverfront access, land use, transportation, and open space along the south shore of the Allegheny River. The plan has been used to guide riverfront development since it was first conceived in 2010.  In Fall 2022, the city will construct the first leg of the recommended shared use bike-pedestrian commuter path.
East End Market-Based Development Strategy (2012): An effort to coordinate activities and functions between six neighborhood organizations along the corridor – Lawrenceville Corporation, and Lawrenceville United, Bloomfield Development Corporation, Bloomfield- Garfield Corporation, Friendship Development Associates, and East Liberty Development Inc.
Lower Lawrenceville (LOLA) Plan (2009): The result of an eight-month planning process building upon the Lawrenceville Community Plan and the Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan. Focused on Butler Street, Doughboy Square, and the Riverfront and recommended increased density and infill development; streetscape improvements; greening with street trees, neighborhood parks, and riverfront connections; public art and marketing; improved connectivity; and integrated parking and mobility planning.
Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan (2008): An urban design plan and commercial/residential market analysis for the Penn Avenue Corridor from 34th Street to Euclid Avenue. Recommendations included establishing gateways at Doughboy Square, 40th + Penn, and Main + Penn; creating an integrated mobility plan and implementing streetscape improvements; establishing higher density office or residential redevelopment between 39th and Fisk Streets; and the expansion of Arsenal Park.
Mobility
Butler Street Design Guidelines (2019): An explicit set of conditions-based block-by block standards for streetscape components to ensure that future development projects foster a safe, accessible, and beautiful Butler Street for all, regardless of the mode of transportation. Encompass the length of Butler Street and make recommendations for the design, materials, fabrication, installation, and maintenance for the following streetscape elements: ADA accessible walkways, sidewalks, street trees, public art, street lighting, stormwater management, street furniture, way-finding signage, cycling and public transportation amenities, and other elements as appropriate.
2015 Updated Parking Study (2015): An update to the 2012 parking study, this study sought to understand the current parking conditions in Lawrenceville and identify potential parking opportunities and improvements. Found that bike parking and on-street car parking along Butler had b0th increased since 2012. However, this supply growth was outpaced by a growth in parking demand, which was especially high from 37th to 45th Street. Recommended encouraging other modes of transportation, facilitating shared parking agreements, and creating additional opportunities for off-street parking.
Penn Avenue Streetscape Program (2009): Building off of the Penn Avenue Corridor Master Plan, this streetscape program develops a palette of recommended sidewalk, transit, pole, and place-making elements along Penn Avenue. Lawrenceville-specific recommendations are highlighted for Doughboy Square, the Penn-Main intersection, and the residential area in between.
Environment
Leslie Park Master Plan (2015): Provides a framework to establish Leslie Park as a neighborhood resource for recreation, performance, and exhibition. The Plan will be undergoing a city-led update in 2023.
Arsenal Park Master Plan (2014): A plan to balance and protect Arsenal Park’s rich history with new and restored amenities to support contemporary community life. The plan is now undergoing a city-led update before final implementation.
Releaf Lawrenceville (2014): With a tree canopy cover of nearly half of the city-wide average, this plan was developed to increase and improve Lawrenceville’s tree canopy cover. It recommends programs targeted at homeowners, industrial property owners, commercial property owners, cemeteries, and community spaces.
Historic Preservation
Lawrenceville Residential Design Guidelines (2013): Created to assist homeowners with façade restoration, these guidelines help to preserve, enhance and celebrate the historical integrity of Lawrenceville’s architectural heritage.
The Archives
Who Moves to Lawrenceville and Why? (2012): A study that interrogated the reasons why people moved to or from Lawrenceville meant to provide community leaders with an understanding of the factors driving recent change in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood.
3400 Doughboy Square Urban Design Program (2012): Initiated by Lawrenceville Corporation, this was an urban design study to develop building recommendations for the site located at 3400 Penn Avenue in Doughboy Square. Building from this study, Lawrenceville Corporation brought on Action Housing to develop the site as affordable housing. The Sixth Ward Flats is the result of this partnership, completed in 2021. Read more about the Sixth Ward Flats here.
Lawrenceville Community Plan (2006): A comprehensive plan of the three Lawrenceville neighborhoods, led by Lawrenceville Corporation, Lawrenceville United, and the Lawrenceville Stakeholders.

Mobility Enhancement DistrictHome » COMMUNITY » Mobility Enhancement District            Starting November 1, 2024 the Mobility Enhancement District goes into effect.
This program will better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville while funding much needed mobility and infrastructure improvements.
*There will be a grace period from November 1st through November 14th*      
Why the changes?
Metered parking allows for better access to spots along our busy neighborhood streets leading to a higher rate of turnover for local businesses. The collected revenue goes into a dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville.
The community will meet annually to decide how the funds will be used.
Some possible options for the funds would be to implement sidewalk improvements, build bus shelters, add bike paths, or YOUR IDEA to help support the mobility and access to our community.   Curious how we got to this decision? 
Read below for a breakdown of past communications, community meetings, and information. If you have any additional questions, please reach out!   Visit our FAQ page about this process!   Mobility Enhancement District Implementation Phase   What is a Mobility Enhancement District?
The Mobility Enhancement District is legislation written by Councilwoman Deb Gross that aims to better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville, while funding much-needed mobility and infrastructure improvements to make Lawrenceville safer, more accessible, and easier to get around for all community members, while increasing foot traffic that our small business community depends on.
A dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville, which would come from:  New meters along Butler Street 
Nighttime enforcement of meters
Dynamic pricing that would capture extra revenue when demand is at its peak
This is a 1 year pilot   
We want your Feedback   
Read More and ask Questions of City Staff on the Lawrenceville Mobility Enhancement Engage Page
Read the meeting recap
Fill out the LC/LU Feedback Form   
Our Engagement in 2023   April 13th, 6:30PM at Arsenal Middle School: Kickoff Community Meeting (recap here)
April 18th, 5pm-7pm at Trace Brewing: Open House #1
April 29th, 11am-2pm at Ice House Studios: Open House #2
May 1st, 11am-2pm at Boys and Girls Club: Open House #3
May 11th, 6:30pm at Goodwill: Closing Community Meeting   
What are the goals of this process?    Create positive, community-determined mobility enhancements to our neighborhood streets to benefit the community members and our visitors, including: sidewalk repair, bus shelters, parking solutions, etc. 
Improve our public infrastructure 
Manage parking demand more effectively     
What is a Mobility Enhancement District (MED)?   The Mobility Enhancement District is an ordinance written by Councilwoman Deb Gross that aims to better manage parking demand along the commercial district in Lawrenceville, while funding much-needed mobility and infrastructure improvements to make Lawrenceville safer, more accessible, and easier to get around for all community members, while increasing foot traffic that our small business community depends on.
Quick notes:
-Legislation (read here) has been introduced by Councilwoman Gross and is sitting in committee
-This would create a dedicated, locally controlled source of funds for mobility improvements in Lawrenceville, which would come from:  New meters along Butler Street and Penn Avenue
Nighttime enforcement of meters
Dynamic pricing that would capture extra revenue when demand is at its peak
Potential uses of MED based off of Butler Street Design Guidelines Plan (est. 2019): Bus shelters
Sidewalk repairs
Bike infrastructure
Traffic Calming
Give us your feedback!  Note: Revenue for the fund would NOT come from enforcement (ticketing).   Examples:               
                        
Map of Proposed Mobility Enhancement District       What is Residential Permit Parking (RPP)?   A program that gives residents of a designated area a better chance to park near their home. A permit costs $20 per vehicle, per program year. People without the permit are allowed to park in the designated RPP areas for one hour before being subject to a ticket.
Key questions we want community input on: Is there demand for new RPP areas on residential blocks that are experiencing high parking demand and don’t currently require permits?
Are changes necessary to hours of enforcement to better manage parking demand in the evening? (for example, would noon to midnight be better enforcement hours in RPP areas instead of 7 AM to 7 PM?)
Is there interest in hybrid zones (an RPP area that would additionally allow for non-residents to pay for parking at a meter)?           
   
                What are Some Residential Permit Parking Options (RPP)?   To get community members thinking about the questions listed in the previous section, we are sharing three options for how different versions of RPP and Hybrid RPP areas might be configured. THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY OPTIONS. These options are not proposals that we’re trying to advance, so much as three different ideas to consider while we invite your feedback on possible RPP changes and while we try to determine where consensus may exist in the community.
Option A – Status Quo – Keep RPP how it currently is in Lawrenceville
Option B – Add RPP and Hybrid Zones
Option C – All RPP with Meters   
RPP Reconfiguration Examples

Neighborhood Metrics
Over the past several years, Lawrenceville Corporation has helped create a Lawrenceville community of growing opportunities. Our neighborhood has changed dramatically as a result, and so too has our charge as an organization. As we continue efforts to better serve the Lawrenceville that exists today, we must begin by honoring and understanding our neighborhood’s past and everything that has happened to get us here. 
To this end, Lawrenceville Corporation began an effort in 2021 to understand and document neighborhood change, an effort which culminated in the Lawrenceville Neighborhood Metrics Report. The report brings together information from census and municipal data, expertise from contacts across the city, and insights from our own programs and research. In some instances, it reveals truths hidden beneath the surface. In others, it reflects and affirms the lived experience of our community members, serving to quantify and contextualize these observations. 
Information is an invaluable resource, and it is the goal of this project to share it with the broader community, with this webpage as the central hub. Read the full report now, or continue below for the highlights.

Housing uses a variety of sources to investigate housing composition, rising costs, the loss of subsidized housing availability, and new affordable housing developments.

Economic Vibrancy  The second part of the report, Economic Vibrancy, is broken into two sections: Lawrenceville’s Main Street Corridors is the result of a business district-wide survey led by LC staff in March 2022. Through this effort, we collected information including occupancy, condition of storefront, and type of business, among others.
Economic Development and Investment is the result of an analysis of building permits, real estate sales, and ownership, as well as a review of development projects brought through the community process in recent years.                                         Land Use & Environment  Part three of the report, Land Use and Environment, explores the following: Land Use includes current zoning and land use data.

Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!

About Ice House StudiosHome » About Ice House Studios      
History
In June 2001, the Ice House Artist Studios at 100 43rd Street in Lawrenceville opened its doors as a new facility for 32 artists, arts-related businesses and arts organizations. The project was enthusiastically supported by the Lawrenceville community for its re-use of a long-abandoned, historic building and its attraction of artists and new businesses to the neighborhood. The National Park Service granted historic status late in 2000 by listing the property on the National Register of Historic Places.
The 35,000 sq. ft. ice house building was originally constructed in 1907 by the Consolidated Ice Company and operated as an ice making facility until the early 50s. The property was used only sporadically over the second half of the century and was a tremendous eyesore in the community with its boarded-up windows and generally run­ down condition.
Artists and Cities secured an option on the property in May 1999. Working with Perkins Eastman Architects and Sota Construction Services, construction began in October, 2000 and was completed by the end of May, 2001. Our design increased the building floor plan from 35,000 sq. ft. to 44,000 sq. ft. and provided for 32 spaces ranging in size from 427 sq. ft. to 2,500 sq. ft.     
Today
Ice House Studios continues to offer affordable studio spaces for artists and makers. It is currently owned by Ice Factory Limited Partnership and is managed by Lawrenceville Corporation. It is home to 30 artists and organizations.
Amenities include: Fully private workspaces range in size from 400 sqft to 2,500 sqft.

For an amazing twenty-six years, we’ve been ringing in the holiday season by inviting folks to join us in Lawrenceville’s business district to do their holiday shopping, meet our local business owners and snack on all kinds of homemade cookies. The Cookie Tour has grown into an absolute sensation, becoming one of the largest and most sought-after holiday events in the entire region. Not only is it a festive extravaganza, but it’s also a lifeline for our cherished small businesses.   
As we get closer to the event, we’ll publish a map that showcases all the amazing businesses participating. Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!

Organizational Committees   
Our work is guided by our Board of Directors in addition to advisory committees that inform the work of the Board of Directors and the Staff of the organization:     
Board of Directors
Composed of all elected Board Members the board steers the organization towards a sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical, and legal governance and financial management policies, as well as making sure the organization has adequate resources to advance its mission, hiring, and managing of the Executive Director.
Executive Committee
Composed of the President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary, the Executive Committee has the power and authority to transact LC’s regular business in the intervals between meetings of the Board. We reported all actions at the next regular meeting. The Executive Committee annually reviews the Executive Director and also oversees the Board’s work related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  
Finance Committee
Comprised of the Treasurer and no less than two other Board Members, in addition to other LC Members. The Finance Committee monitors the financial activities of LC and serves as a liaison with LC’s outside auditors.
Business District Advisory Committee
Composed of Lawrenceville businesses and their employees. This Committee works to inform the work of LC that is focused on supporting small businesses, marketing and promotional events, and other programming related to the business community.      Community Development Committee
The Community Development Committee reviews and informs community plans and development projects. This committee advises staff and LC’s Board on positions to take related to development-related programming, projects, and planning processes
Nominating Committee
Supports the Board of Directors in fulfilling its fiduciary duties to recruit and appoint the best-qualified candidates for the Board of Directors and Board Officer positions to a slate that is brought to Membership for approval.
Governance Committee
Responsible for reviewing the governance structures, practices of the organization, report its findings, and making recommendations to the Board. The Governance Committee evaluates the performance of the existing Board in addition to organizational committees. This Committee also reviews and works with the Board to update LC’s mission, vision, values of the organization, and its governing documents (the articles of incorporation, bylaws, conflict of interest policy). The Committee works closely with the Nominating Committee to monitor the Board Nominations and Elections Process.
Asset Management Committee
The Asset Management Committee guides and informs LC’s real estate strategy, programming for common spaces, capital improvements, and general maintenance work related to LC – owned properties such as the Ice House and Blackbird Studios.

Mark your calendars because the Cookie Tour is happening on Saturday, December 9th, and Sunday, December 10th, from 12 pm to 5 pm. That’s two whole days of scrumptious adventure waiting for you!   
For an amazing twenty-six years, we’ve been ringing in the holiday season by inviting folks to join us in Lawrenceville’s business district to do their holiday shopping, meet our local business owners and snack on all kinds of homemade cookies. The Cookie Tour has grown into an absolute sensation, becoming one of the largest and most sought-after holiday events in the entire region. Not only is it a festive extravaganza, but it’s also a lifeline for our cherished small businesses.   
As we get closer to the event, we’ll publish a map that showcases all the amazing businesses participating. Keep an eye out for those adorable gingerbread people outside these businesses – they’re your tasty beacons, guiding you to the most delectable cookie stops in town! Major updates will be posted here, but the best way to follow along is on the event’s Facebook and Instagram.   
And if that’s not enough, we’ll have an event trolley that’ll whisk you through Upper, Central, and Lower Lawrenceville, spanning both Butler Street AND Penn Avenue. Can you rise to the challenge and visit all 79 stops? Get ready for the sweetest adventure of the year! Lawrenceville Cookie Tour 2023 – let’s make it a cookie-tastic extravaganza like no other!     We are also bringing back the Cookie Tour Cup – which business has the best cookie?! You get to decide. A trophy will go to the people’s choice for best cookie of the tour.

Calling all LGBTQIA+, allied businesses, and creatives in Lawrenceville! Brace yourselves for the ultimate pride celebration on Saturday June 15th, 2024. This day will feature a series of events and opportunities throughout Lawrenceville, as local businesses show their pride, love, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community.
Lawrenceville is a place where creative people and ideas meet, and lifelong friendships and memories are made.  A community built strong with residents, visitors, and business owners. What better neighborhood than Lawrenceville to celebrate our LGBTQIA+ community with a neighborhood-wide pride event?
Lawrenceville Pride is designed to offer opportunity for the community to support local small businesses that continually provide essential resources to our queer neighbors. An inclusive event that cultivates equality, selflessness, and love.
Queer and allied business owners in Lawrenceville strive to create a safe and comforting environment resulting in a more impactful event each year. As the community continues to grow, our hope is to make LV Pride as effective as possible in providing a cherished experience for the community.
An exciting addition this year’s Lawrenceville Pride is the Pride Kick-Off event at Iron City Boulders on Friday, June 14th. Jump start your Lawrenceville Pride Weekend with an after-hours drag show starting at 10PM.
Join the celebration on June 15th from 12-5pm for food, fun, beer, and friends. As a community built on solidarity and trust, Lawrenceville is committed to protecting and supporting our neighbors beyond this event and the month of June and we need YOU to do the same.

We're back!
We are happy to announce the
2024 Hickory Apple Festival will return on October 5th and 6th. You will be able to experience all of your favorites such as live
entertainment, unique crafters, homemade brick oven bread, delicious apple crisp and MORE!  We promise to keep the tight knit feel of our small town and beloved community at the heart of this
event.
The Hickory Apple Festival is
the largest fundraiser for the Mt. Pleasant Twp VFC which services 88 miles of road for ~3,500 residents and a number of businesses. The fire company thrives because of the hard work and dedication
of its members, including the Ladies Auxiliary, and the generous support of the people, businesses, and organizations from the township and nearby communities.
