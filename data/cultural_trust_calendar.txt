Event Title: The Fall (2006). Date and Time: Fri, Oct 18 - Wed, Oct 23, 2024.nVenue: Harris Theater. Organization: Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Description: Don't miss this cult classic, long unavailable for viewing, and newly restored in all its stunning glory!In silent-era Hollywood, stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is brought to a hospital after an on-set accident leaves him paralysed. There, he befriends a young girl called Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) and starts telling her a fantastical tale of epic heroes trying to take revenge on an evil ruler - whilst secretly planning his own suicide. He captivates her with this whimsical story that removes her far from the hospital doldrums into the exotic landscapes of her imagination.“Tarsem Singh’s ‘The Fall’ is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself. Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance ‘The Fall,’ filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.”—Roger EbertDirected by Tarsem Singh2006 | USA, India | English, Romanian, and Latin language with English subtitles | DCPRated R Online sales end 15 minutes prior to showtime.

Event Title: Panel discussion: Peggy Ahwesh, Susan Chainey, and Jim Hubbard. Date and Time: Sat, Nov  9, 2024.nVenue: Wood Street Galleries. Organization: Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Description: In conjunction with the exhibitionRoger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Storieson view at Wood Street Galleries from October 25, 2024–January 5, 2025, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is pleased to announce a panel discussion with Peggy Ahwesh, Susan Chainey, and Jim Hubbard moderated by Anastasia James Director of Galleries & Public Art at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Wood Street Galleries at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust proudly presentsRoger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories, featuring the world premiere of three newly restored films by experimental filmmaker Roger Jacoby (1944–1985). Jacoby’s work occupies a critical yet under-examined space at the intersection of avant-garde cinema and queer experimental filmmaking during the pre- and post-liberation eras. Though his career was tragically brief, from 1972 until his death from AIDS in 1985, Jacoby’s films reflect an intensely personal and autobiographical vision, blending elements of structural film, diaristic cinema, and meditations on queer identity. His work is deeply connected to Pittsburgh, a city whose cultural underground has long supported artists working outside the mainstream. In this panel discussion, we explore Jacoby's unique artistic journey and contributions to experimental media, alongside renowned filmmakers Peggy Ahwesh and Jim Hubbard, and curator Susan Chainey. Jacoby’s films, produced in Pittsburgh and influenced by his experiences in New York’s avant-garde scene, were shaped by his relationships with key figures like Andy Warhol, Ondine, and Marie Menken. His hand-processed, DIY approach to filmmaking—often using his own bathtub—imbued his work with a distinct materiality and intimacy. The restored films featured in this exhibition, includingDream Sphinx Opera(1973) andHow to Be a Homosexual Part I(1980), offer a rare glimpse into Jacoby’s exploration of identity, community, and the personal-political intersections that defined his remarkable yet underappreciated career.

Event Title: Day With(out) Art 2024: Red Reminds Me…. Date and Time: Sun, Dec  1, 2024.nVenue: Wood Street Galleries. Organization: Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Description: Wood Streeet Galleries at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is proud to partner withVisual AIDSfor Day With(out) Art 2024 by presentingRed Reminds Me…, a program of seven videos reflecting the emotional spectrum of living with HIV today. Red Reminds Me…will feature newly commissioned videos byGian Cruz(Philippines),Milko Delgado(Panama),Imani Harrington(USA),David Oscar Harvey(USA),Mariana IaconoandJuan De La Mar(Argentina/Colombia),Nixie(Belgium), andVasilios Papapitsios(USA). Through the red ribbon and other visuals, HIV and AIDS has been long associated with the color red and its connotations—blood, pain, tragedy, and anger.Red Reminds Me…invites viewers to consider a complex range of images and feelings surrounding HIV, from eroticism and intimacy, mothering and kinship, luck and chance, memory and haunting. The commissioned artists deploy parody, melodrama, theater, irony, and horror to build a new vocabulary for representing HIV today. The title is drawn from the words of Stacy Jennings, an activist, poet, and long-term survivor with HIV, who writes: “Red reminds me, red reminds me, red reminds me…to be free.” *Linking “red” to freedom, Jennings flips the usual connotations of the color and offers a new way of thinking about the complexity of living with HIV. Just as a prism bends and refracts light, Red Reminds Me…, expands the emotional spectrum of living with HIV. It shows us that while grief, tragedy, and anger define parts of the epidemic, the full picture contains deeper, nuanced, and sometimes contradictory feelings. Please stop by Wood Street Galleries on Sunday December 1st between the hours of 11am-5pm to view this year’s Day Without Art films. For more information about participating artists and their videos see below. Visual AIDS is a New York-based non-profit that utilizes art to fight AIDS by provoking dialogue, supporting HIV+ artists, and preserving a legacy, because AIDS is not over. Gian Cruz,Dear Kwong Chi InDear Kwong Chi, Cruz creates a video letter to the late artist Tseng Kwong Chi, drawing from the experience of living with HIV in diaspora. Across continents and decades, Kwong Chi’s legacy acts as an anchor for Cruz amongst limited representations of Asian narratives in AIDS histories. Milko Delgado,El Club del SIDA Taking its title from a sensational telenovela episode,El Club del SIDAcycles through a lifetime of heavily stigmatizing images about HIV and AIDS. Delgado plays with multiple aesthetics—documentary, horror, comedy—to explore the various relationships he has had with AIDS over the course of his life. Imani Harrington,Realms Remix Through a collage of poetry and archival images,Realms Remixtraces memories and sensations of an AIDS past that continue to haunt the present. David Oscar Harvey,Ambivalence: On HIV & Luck Ambivalence: On HIV & Lucktackles the disorienting experience of existing with a manageable condition that our present culture insists on representing in terms of its bleak past. Interested in figuring HIV differently, the film presents a series of visual puns merging the iconography of HIV and AIDS with popular symbols of luck. Mariana Iacono and Juan De La Mar,El VIH se enamoró de mi (HIV Fell in Love With Me) HIV Fell in Love With Metells the story of a woman with HIV embracing her sexuality and reconnecting with her pleasure. Filmed with an erotic aesthetic, the video reflects a pursuit towards sexual justice and autonomy for women living with HIV. Nixie,it’s giving Through home videos, archival footage and textile landscapes,it’s givingexplores various forms of family across time. The artist's domestic life is paired with archival video of queer and trans chosen families mirroring small acts of joy, resistance, and sustenance. What does it mean for an HIV+ person, who carries the history and present of the AIDS-crisis in their DNA, to foster new life? Vasilios Papapitsios,LUCID NIGHTMARE Papapitsios describesLUCID NIGHTMAREas a “meditation on how we can(not) heal in the environments that make us sick, from the perspective of an infected neurodivergent faggot.” Combining auto-fiction with magical realism, Papapitsios humorously reimagines narratives around mental health and chronic illness. *Jennings recites this poem in the videoHere We Are: Voices of Black Women Who Live with HIV, created by Davina “Dee” Conner and Karin Hayes for Day With(out) Art 2022: Being and Belonging.

Event Title: Gerard Malanga: Secret Cinema. Date and Time: Mon, Dec  9, 2024.nVenue: Harris Theater. Organization: Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Description: 7pm: Screening8pm: Poetry Reading | Q&A Gerard Malanga played a pivotal role in Andy Warhol's creative output during the 1960's, serving as Warhol’s chief assistant from 1963 to 1970. For one evening only, The Harris Theatre will present the world premiere of three newly restored films by Gerard Malanga who will participate in a post screening poetry reading and Q&A. Often described as Warhol’s most important collaborator, Malanga was integral to many of Warhol's most iconic works, including the production of his silkscreen paintings, films, and multimedia projects. He was heavily involved in Warhol’s filmmaking process, co-directing, editing, and starring in several of Warhol’s films, including the famedScreen Tests. His deep involvement in Warhol's work extended to photography and poetry, as well as assisting with the Factory’s day-to-day operations. Beyond technical and administrative support, Malanga’s creative influence was significant. His collaboration helped shape the experimental ethos of Warhol’s art, particularly through his work on theExploding Plastic Inevitablemultimedia shows and other avant-garde projects. Malanga’s presence also symbolized the convergence of art, poetry, and underground culture at the Factory, making him a key figure in Warhol’s broader artistic circle. His artistic contributions, coupled with his close personal relationship with Warhol, solidify his role as a crucial figure in the development of Warhol’s iconic body of work during this formative period. The special screening presents the world-premier of three newly restored films that offer a unique insight into Andy Warhol’s world and the 1960s New York avant-garde scene. Central to the program isAndy Warhol: Portraits of the Artist as a Young Man(1964–1965), seven short films that mimic Warhol'sScreen Testswhile focusing on Warhol himself, offering a rare glimpse into his persona. The program also includesFilm Notebooks, 1964–1970, a restored compilation of unseen footage from Malanga's personal archive, documenting interactions with notable figures like Bob Dylan and Edie Sedgwick. The final film,The Filmmaker Records a Portion of His Life in the Month of August, 1968, presents an intimate, autobiographical portrait of Malanga’s summer in 1968, capturing fleeting moments with Warhol and other New York artists. Together, these films highlight Malanga’s archival retrieval process and collaborative spirit, offering an immersive look at the artistic environment surrounding Warhol and his Factory.
