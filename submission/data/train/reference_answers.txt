The Great American Banana Split Celebration includes activities like candy bar bingo, crafts, face painting, games, goat yoga, and a Banana Run, among others.
Contestants must use bananas as an ingredient, bake from scratch without mixes, and attach the recipe to their entry. No refrigeration-required items are allowed.
The Banana Split was invented in 1904 by David Strickler in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. It quickly gained popularity and was declared the official dessert of Pennsylvania.
The Blood Drive is scheduled for Friday, August 23, 2024, from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm.
